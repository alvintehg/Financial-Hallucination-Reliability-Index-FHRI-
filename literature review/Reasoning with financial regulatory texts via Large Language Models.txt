Interpreting  complex  financial  regulatory  texts, such as the Basel III Accords,  can be challenging  even for 
human experts. In this paper, we explore the potential  of Large Language  Models (LLMs) to perform  such tasks. 
Specifically,  we evaluate  reasoning  strategies,  namely Chain-of-Thought  (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought  (ToT), in 
their ability to assign accurate  risk weights to test cases based on the Basel III Standardized  Approach  (SA) 
for Credit Risk. Moreover,  we propose  and test a guided learning-based  few-shot  variant of CoT and ToT 
using human expert input. By evaluating  6,501 test cases, comprised  of diverse exposure  scenarios,  our results 
demonstrate  that few-shot  prompting  with CoT as well as ToT significantly  enhances  the LLMs’ accuracy  in 
inferring  risk weights.  For one-shot  CoT, we observe gains of almost 13 percentage  points in accuracy  with 
GPT-4o,  whereas  Claude 3 Sonnet shows gains of more than 10 percentage  points. Albeit smaller in magnitude,  
one-shot  ToT improvements  are around 9 percentage  points.
1. Introduction
Over the past few decades,  keeping  up with financial  regulation  
has become  a major hurdle for financial  institutions.  Take the Basel 
Accords  as an example:  The first version  of the Basel Accords,  Basel 
I, fit into about 30 pages, Basel II multiplied  to about 300, and Basel 
III now stretches  to nearly 1900 pages (The Basel Framework , 2024 ). 
Each new layer of the Basel Accords  is meant to strengthen  the financial  
system (Levine , 2012 ; Tarullo , 2019 ; The Basel Framework , 2024 ), 
but the sheer volume  makes compliance  departments’  work tough and 
translates  in high expenditure  cost for banks (Fazlija et al., 2024 ). As 
highlighted  by EFD (2023 ), Swiss banks alone spent an estimated  CHF 
720 million  for the finalization  of Basel III (‘‘Basel  IV’’). And it is not 
only the Basel Accords:  Thomson  Reuters  (2023 ) shows that in 2022 
regulators  around  the word issued more than 61,000 regulatory  events. 
This makes regulatory  compliance  a critical and resource-intensive  
challenge  for financial  institutions.
Parsing  those dense documents  is still largely a manual  and time in-
tense process.  Traditional  rule-based  systems  struggle  with the nuanced  
language  and context  of lengthy  policies.  As stated by De Lucio and 
Mora-Sanguinetti  (2021 ), understanding  the economic  cost of regula-
tory complexity  may require  new text-mining  tools. That is were recent

AI’s growing  influence  is hard to miss: The 2024 Nobel Prizes 
in Physics  and Chemistry  honored  core advances  in deep learning  
and the development  of AlphaFold2,  an AI system that cracked  the 
protein-folding  problem.  Goodell  et al. (2021 ) demonstrates  that AI 
has already  found its way into finance,  including  risk assessment  and 
regulatory  compliance.  AI has already  transformed  areas such as stock 
behavior  prediction  (Gu et al., 2020 ; Rossi , 2018 ; Zhong and Enke , 
2019 ), derivative  hedging  (Becker et al., 2020 ; Buehler  et al., 2019 ), 
robo-advisors  (Shanmuganathan , 2020 ), fraud detection  (Dornadula  
and Geetha , 2019 ; Gregory  and Vito, 2024 ; Aros et al., 2024 ; Xu 
et al., 2024 ; Zhou et al., 2023 ), and sustainable  finance  (Bingler  et al., 
2022 ; Webersinke  et al., 2021 ). However,  the existing  literature  deals 
mostly with structured  problems  like flagging  suspicious  transactions  or 
classifying  texts by risk. Minor attention  has been given to AI that can 
reason through  the content  of regulation  itself. The emergence  of LLMs 
opens new possibilities  for tackling  regulatory  challenges,  where deep 
understanding  and precise reasoning  over complex  texts are crucial.
Recent research  has explored  using LLMs for regulatory  applica-
tions. Micheler  and Whaley  (2020 ) discuss the potential  of AI to auto-
mate compliance  by replacing  rules written  in natural  legal language

by computer  code. Achitouv  et al. (2023 ) use ten relatively  small 
language  models,  such as bert-base-nli-mean-tokens  and all-MiniLM-L12-
v2, to match regulations  (Financial  Conduct  Authority  (FCA) Rulebook  
2022) to internal  policies.  Cao and Feinstein  (2024 ) study the inter-
pretation  of Basel III capital requirements  for Market  Risk using LLM 
prompting  techniques.  Fazlija et al. (2024 ) focus on generating  Python  
code from regulatory  texts, demonstrating  the feasibility  of LLM-driven  
automation  for regulatory  implementation.
In this paper, we contribute  to this emerging  line of research  by 
evaluating  the capabilities  of LLMs to interpret  regulatory  texts through  
a large set of test cases created  in Fazlija et al. (2024 ) focused  on the 
task of assigning  risk weights under the Basel III Standardized  Approach  
(SA) for credit risk. Under the SA, banks must maintain  a minimum  
capital ratio (e.g., 8%) relative  to their risk-weighted  assets (RWA).  
RWAs are calculated  by applying  prescribed  risk weights  to credit 
exposures,  depending  on factors such as counterparty  type, asset class, 
credit quality,  maturity,  and currency  denomination.
For an illustration  of the concept  of risk weights  and their calcula-
tion, we refer to the example  provided  in Fazlija et al. (2024 ).
The regulatory  text specifies  such risk weights  in exhaustive  detail, 
leading  to high complexity  due to the multitude  of possible  cases. We 
refer to each such exposure  scenario  and corresponding  risk weight as 
a test case. To evaluate  LLM performance,  we formulate  a targeted  
regulatory  reasoning  task: for a given credit belonging  to a specified  
exposure  class, we provide  the LLM with the relevant  regulatory  articles  
that govern the risk weights  for that class, and ask the LLM to determine  
the correct risk weight based solely on the provided  text. This setup 
closely mirrors  real-world  compliance  workflows,  where practitioners  
must apply specific  regulatory  rules to individual  credit exposures.
The two major prompting  strategies  that we use are:
•Zero-shot  prompting , where the LLM receives  only the task 
instruction.
•Few-shot  prompting , where the LLM is provided  with illustrative  
examples  of correct reasoning  steps.
To enhance  reasoning  abilities  for complex  tasks, prompting  tech-
niques such as Chain-of-Thought  (CoT; Wei et al., 2022 ) and Tree-of-
Thought  (ToT; Long , 2023 ; Yao et al., 2024 ) have been developed.  
These methods  encourage  large language  models  (LLMs) to reason step-
by-step  or in a branching  manner,  improving  their performance  on 
symbolic,  multi-step  problems.  Sprague  et al. (2024 ) show that CoT 
is particularly  helpful for mathematical  and logical tasks, while being 
less beneficial  for others. However,  providing  examples  for few-shot  
prompting  for reasoning  strategies  like CoT or ToT remains  time-
consuming,  especially  when high-quality,  fully accurate  rationales  are 
required.  While methods  for automatic  generation  of CoT rationales  – 
such as Auto-CoT  (Zhang et al., 2022 ) – do exist, they are not directly  
applicable  to the regulatory  context  considered  here. Simple examples  
are unlikely  to help a language  model infer risk weights  for test case 
inputs based on complex  regulatory  texts. Additionally,  Auto-CoT’s  
clustering-based  approach  is not useful in this setting,  as the test cases 
are already  nested into 13 exposure  classes.
In this paper, we propose  a simple yet effective  few-shot  prompting  
variant  for CoT and ToT methods,  specifically  tailored  for regulatory  
text interpretation.  This setup can be illustrated  with the following  
illustrative  example  (for a concrete  example  in the zero-shot  setting,  
see Appendix   B.) (see Fig.  1):
Our work provides  new insights  into the capabilities  and limitations  
of LLMs for high-stakes  regulatory  interpretation  tasks and contributes  
to building  more automated  and reliable  compliance  solutions  for the 
banking  industry.
The remainder  of the paper is structured  as follows:  Section  2 
describes  the methodology,  including  the dataset,  the construction  of 
test cases, and the CoT and ToT reasoning-enhancing  methods  with 
their zero-shot  and few-shot  variants.  Section  3 presents  the empirical  results and compares  the accuracy  of different  prompting  strategies  
across models  and exposure  classes.  Section  4 discusses  the implica-
tions of the findings,  limitations,  and potential  directions  for future 
research.  Appendices  provide  detailed  prompts  and additional  technical  
information  used in the experiments.
2. Methodology
Fig.  2 provides  an overview  of our methodology.  We employ  GPT-4o  
and Claude 3 Sonnet,  along with the reasoning-enhancing  methods  CoT 
and ToT, for which we also propose  few-shot  variants  and evaluate  their 
effectiveness  in assigning  correct risk weights  based on given inputs.
We begin by converting  test cases (see Section  2.1) from the Basel 
III dataset  provided  by Fazlija et al. (2024 ), into a format compatible  
with LLMs. Subsequently,  we formulate  prompts  for zero-shot  and 
examples  from the given data for few-shot  learning  for CoT and ToT. 
Each test case, along with its corresponding  articles  and assumptions,  
is integrated  into the prompts  to determine  the risk weight.  Finally,  we 
assess the accuracy  of the results produced  by each reasoning  method.
We restrict ourselves  to one-shot  prompting  for CoT and ToT. For 
the one-shot  example,  we ask a human subject matter expert (one of 
the co-authors)  to provide,  for each exposure  class, based on the texts 
only, the test case perceived  as most difficult.  Using the corresponding  
texts and zero-shot  variants  of CoT and ToT, we generate  rationales  
and check them manually  for correctness,  thus getting pairs of texts 
and corresponding  rationales,  which are then used as examples  for the 
one-shot  prompting.  This method  also works for 𝑘-shot learning,  with 
𝑘 >1, demanding  more human expert effort.
2.1. Test cases
To create the list of compatible  test cases, we utilize the Basel III-
based dataset  by Fazlija et al. (2024 ). This dataset  contains  13 exposure  
classes related to the Standardized  Approach:  individual  exposures  
approach.  Each exposure  class in the dataset  includes:
1.Articles  relevant  to that exposure  class
2.A ground  truth code (GTC) for determining  the risk weight
3.Test cases for the GTC
4.The assumptions  underlying  the development  of the GTC.
In total, the dataset  contains  6501 test cases providing  a compre-
hensive  foundation  for evaluating  risk weights  across various  exposure  
scenarios.  The test cases in the dataset  are categorized  into two types:
•Valid test cases: These test cases consist of combinations  of valid 
values for the input variables,  with the corresponding  risk weight 
as the output.
•Invalid  test cases: These test cases include  combinations  of both 
valid and invalid values for the input variables,  which may result 
in an ‘‘Invalid  input value!’’  output.
Fazlija et al. (2024 ) designed  test cases for each exposure  class 
through  a structured  approach.  They identified  the variables  influenc-
ing risk weight assignment,  defined  their possible  values, and generated  
test cases by combining  these values. The next step involved  creating  
GTC to assign risk weights  to the test cases based on regulatory  re-
quirements,  followed  by an expert review to verify the accuracy  of the 
assigned  risk weights.  Subsection  text.
The available  test cases are structured  for use in Python  code. 
However,  since these test cases need to be incorporated  into a prompt,  
we convert  them into a text format by listing each variable  name 
alongside  its corresponding  value. Since the goal is to infer the risk 
weight using LLMs, we do not consider  the risk weight part of the test 
case here. For example,  in ‘Exposures  to retail’ class, converted  valid 
test cases (non-exhaustive)  are shown below:Journal  of Behavioral  and Experimental  Finance  47 (2025)  101067

Fig. 1. Example of risk weight assignment  task for a specific credit exposure.
Fig. 2. Overview  of the methodology.  Test cases are first converted  into a usable format. Each test case, together with the articles and assumptions  for the corresponding  exposure  
class, is used in CoT and ToT prompts to generate the risk weight. For few-shot prompting,  one example per exposure  class is generated  by a human expert, based on the most 
complex test case. A prompt is then created to generate reasoning  steps, which are manually  refined and incorporated  into the few-shot CoT and ToT prompts.
Test case 1: exposure_type=Regulatory  retail, transactor=True
Test case 2: exposure_type=Regulatory  retail, transactor=False
Test case 3: exposure_type=Other,  transactor=True
Test case 4: exposure_type=Other,  transactor=False
Here, the variable  ‘exposure_type’  can take the values ‘Regulatory  
retail’ or ‘Other’ , while ‘transactor’  can be either ‘True’ or ‘False’ . These 
test cases are then integrated  into the prompt,  where a LLM is tasked 
to determine  the correct risk weight,  as shown in the next section.
2.2. Reasoning  methods
As mentioned,  we utilize zero-shot  and few-shot  CoT and ToT 
reasoning  methods.  Below, we provide  a detailed  description  of each 
reasoning  method  and the structure  of the formulated  prompts.
Chain-of-thought  (CoT): For CoT reasoning,  the LLM is prompted  
to mimic a human problem-solving  process  of solving  a task by splitting  
it in intermediate  reasoning  steps:
•Zero-shot  CoT: In this approach,  the model is instructed  to 
perform  intermediate  reasoning  steps without  any examples.  This 
is achieved  by including  a simple instruction  in the prompt,  such 
as ‘‘Let’s think step by step’’. Appendix   A shows our prompt  for 
this approach.•Few-shot  CoT: This method  involves  providing  the model with 
a few examples  of CoT reasoning  (Appendix   C). The examples  
‘‘guide’’  the model to learn and replicate  the reasoning  process  
when completing  the given task. We use human expert input to 
find the most informative  examples  by selecting  the most complex  
test cases from each exposure  class to perform  one-shot  CoT. To 
create these examples,  we use articles,  assumptions,  and GTCs 
associated  with that class, along with the selected  test case and 
its expected  output.  This data is incorporated  into a prompt  (see 
Appendix   F), and the language  model is tasked with generating  
CoT reasoning  steps to assign the appropriate  risk weight to 
the given test case. Since the codes are more structured,  the 
reasoning  steps generated  by the model are also more structured  
compared  to the contextual  information  provided  in the articles.  
The generated  reasoning  is then manually  reviewed  and adjusted  
as needed  to ensure accuracy.
Tree-of-thought  (ToT): ToT reasoning  also incorporates  interme-
diate steps; however,  unlike the ‘‘one-directional’’  approach  of CoT, it 
explores  multiple  branches  of reasoning  while self-evaluating  progress.  
We use the method  of Yao et al. (2024 ) and Hulbert  (2023 ) proposing  
a single-sentence  prompt  approach  to ToT, enabling  the method  to be 
executed  with a single call to the model. Like for CoT, ToT can also be 
implemented  in two ways:Journal  of Behavioral  and Experimental  Finance  47 (2025)  101067

•Zero-shot  ToT: To formulate  the prompt  for zero-shot  ToT, where 
no examples  are required,  we modify the task definition  compo-
nent of the CoT prompt  while retaining  the test case, assumptions,  
and articles  components.  The modified  task definition  prompt  
that incorporates  ToT reasoning  is presented  in Appendix   D.
•Few-shot  ToT: In this approach,  we provide  a few examples  of 
ToT reasonings  (Appendix   E). These examples  are created  in the 
same way as CoT examples,  with the prompt  modified  to generate  
ToT reasoning  instead  of CoT (Appendix   G). As such, articles,  as-
sumptions,  and GTCs are utilized  along with the complex  example  
test case for each exposure  class and its expected  output.
2.3. Evaluation  metric and statistical  testing
Since we consider  the output of the LLMs as a categorical  outcome  
(i.e., whether  the risk weight produced  based on the exposure  class 
articles  is correctly  inferred  or not), we use accuracy  as the evaluation  
metric: 
Accuracy =1
𝑁𝑁∑
𝑖=1𝟏{̂ 𝑦𝑖=𝑦𝑖} (1)
where:
•𝑁 is the total number  of the considered  test cases,
•̂ 𝑦𝑖 is the predicted  risk weight by the LLM for the test case 𝑖,
•𝑦𝑖 is the correct risk weight (i.e., the ground  truth) for the test 
case 𝑖,
•𝟏{̂ 𝑦𝑖=𝑦𝑖} is the indicator  function,  which equals 1 if ̂ 𝑦𝑖=𝑦𝑖, and 
0 otherwise.
To statistically  test the differences  between  the used models  and 
prompting  methods  (zero-shot  CoT, one-shot  CoT, etc.), we apply the 
nonparametric  Friedman’s  chi-square  test (Friedman , 1940 ), which can 
be used for multiple  comparisons  with categorical  outcomes.
Given 𝑘 methods  and 𝑛 matched  test cases, the Friedman  statistic  is 
computed  as: 
𝜒2
𝐹=12𝑛
𝑘(𝑘+ 1)[𝑘∑
𝑗=1𝑅2
𝑗−𝑘(𝑘+ 1)2
4]
, (2)
where 𝑅𝑗 is the sum of ranks assigned  to method  𝑗.
If the Friedman  test results in a 𝑝-value <0.01, post-hoc  pairwise  
comparisons  are performed  using the Nemenyi  test (Nemenyi , 1963 ).
3. Results
We used GPT-4o  and Claude 3 Sonnet to infer risk weights  from 
regulatory  articles.  For both models,  the temperature  was set to 1, and 
the maximum  number  of new tokens generated  per request  was limited  
to 4096.
The accuracy  metric was used to evaluate  the results.  Accuracy  was 
calculated  separately  for valid and invalid test cases, as well as for both 
cases combined,  within each exposure  class and across all exposure  
classes.  For one-shot  methods,  accuracy  is reported  only for valid test 
cases, as the selected  examples  are derived  from valid cases, and correct 
reasoning  rationales  are only applicable  to valid test cases. Tables  1and
2 show these results.In Table  1, we observe  clear differences  in accuracies  for the two 
models,  with GPT-4o  showing  consistently  superior  results across all 
reasoning  methods  in both the zero-shot  and one-shot  contexts.  The 
overall best result is achieved  in the one-shot  CoT version,  with an 
accuracy  of 89.33%  by GPT-4o.  GPT-4o  consistently  shows better re-
sults across all methods,  with a maximum  difference  of more than 15
percentage  points for the zero-shot  ToT variant  in invalid test cases and 
almost 13 percentage  points overall.  We also observe  a difference  of 
more than 8 percentage  points in the one-shot  variant  of ToT.
Table  2 shows the results across the different  models  and reasoning  
methods  for each exposure  class separately.  There are pronounced  
differences  among specific  exposure  classes.  For instance,  we observe  
that some exposure  classes (such as Classes 4, 5, and 6) are more 
difficult  for the LLMs to infer risk weights  for than the others. Baseline  
experiments,  where we just asked the LLMs to output the risk weight 
for a given test case input (without  providing  the articles  of the given 
exposure  class), indicate  that this might be due to semantic  prior and 
the corresponding  beliefs the LLMs have about that specific  collection  
of articles,  rather than a particular  reasoning  flaw that would be related 
to the logic of the articles  (such as some complicated  nested rules).
To test statistical  differences,  all models  and reasoning-enhancing  
methods  were applied  to the same set of test cases, representing  a 
repeated  measures  design.  We used the Friedman  chi-square  test across 
all methods.  This nonparametric  test is appropriate  for dependent  
samples,  which, in our case, means that each test case was evaluated  by 
all methods.  Although  some dependency  likely exists between  test cases 
within each exposure  class — potentially  violating  the assumption  of 
independence  between  test cases — the large number  of test cases and 
the resulting  effect size (𝜒2
𝐹= 2614 .899, 𝑝 < 0.01) suggest  statistically  
significant  differences.  Table  3 presents  the pairwise  comparisons  using 
the Nemenyi  post-hoc  test.
From Tables  1, 2, and 3, we observe  that CoT significantly  out-
performs  ToT. This is surprising,  as ToT is generally  considered  more 
advanced  due to its ability to reason through  multiple  reasoning  paths. 
The linear reasoning  of CoT, however,  appears  to be more suitable  for 
the logic of the regulatory  articles  involved.
4. Discussion
In this paper, we demonstrated  that reasoning-enhancing  methods  
like CoT and ToT yield strong results for interpreting  financial  reg-
ulatory  texts. We proposed  a few-shot  variant  of CoT and ToT that 
incorporates  human expert input. These variants  led to significant  
performance  improvements  relative  to their zero-shot  counterparts.  
Surprisingly,  CoT consistently  outperforms  ToT in both the zero-shot  
and few-shot  settings.  The linear reasoning  of CoT results in better 
performance,  possibly  due to the highly structured  nature of the tasks at 
hand, while ToT’s multiple  reasoning  paths may introduce  unnecessary  
complexity  and cause confusion.
For both models,  providing  one human-expert-selected  test case per 
class yields statistically  significant  improvements,  with CoT achieving  
greater  gains—more  than 12 percentage  points for GPT-4o  and more 
than 10 percentage  points for Claude 3 Sonnet.  Thus, we observe  that 
providing  reasoning  rationales  for test cases perceived  by a human 
expert as particularly  difficult  helps the model generalize  better. This Journal  of Behavioral  and Experimental  Finance  47 (2025)  101067

aligns with previous  findings  showing  substantial  improvements  from 
reasoning-enhancing  methods  such as CoT in mathematical  and logical 
tasks (Wei et al., 2022 ; Sprague  et al., 2024 ).
The only other study on financial  regulatory  texts relevant  to this 
discussion  is that of Cao and Feinstein  (2024 ), which explores  varying  
levels of prompting.  Their work distinguishes  between  basic instruc-
tions, intermediate  reasoning  examples,  and fully structured  problem  
solutions.
The results of this work provide  strong evidence  that LLMs can 
be used to infer risk weights  from regulatory  articles.  When viewed  
in the context  of aiding the implementation  of financial  regulations,  
this approach  may serve as a viable strategy  for generating  test cases. 
In conjunction  with the findings  of Fazlija et al. (2024 ), the results 
presented  here point to a promising  pathway  toward  more efficient  
regulatory  implementation.  By combining  insights  from both studies,  
it may be possible  to develop  an integrated  and highly efficient  ap-
proach to regulation—one  that leverages  minimal  human input for test 
case generation  while achieving  high performance  through  advanced  
prompting  strategies.  LLMs could thus be incorporated  into a unified  
workflow  in which both code and test cases are generated  by LLMs, 
with limited  human expert intervention.  Such a strategy  opens avenues  
for further exploration  into automated  regulatory  systems,  which we 
are currently  pursuing  for future research.
There are several directions  in which this work can be extended.  
An obvious  limitation  is the set of models  used. In the fast-paced  
environment  of LLM development  and research,  new and more ad-
vanced  models  emerge  frequently.  Recently,  reasoning-oriented  mod-
els — likely incorporating  elements  of CoT, ToT, and reinforcement  
learning  — have shown substantial  improvements  in symbolic  and 
logical reasoning.  Future research  should compare  our results with 
those of such reasoning  models,  including  o4-mini,  which outperforms  
competitors  on code generation  and symbolic  reasoning  benchmarks.
When it comes to human expert input, the sensitivity  of the pro-
posed few-shot  method  with regard to the selection  of the ‘‘most 
difficult’’  test cases by different  human experts  should be studied.  Furthermore,  approaches  for automatically  selecting  the most relevant  
test cases should be considered.
Moreover,  providing  more than one example  is very likely to help 
the models  generalize  even better — this is well-established  in many 
few-shot  learning  experiments.  It is important  to note that the examples  
used for future regulations  do not need to be up to date, as the 
general  structure  and logic of regulatory  texts remain largely consis-
tent. Testing  on new regulatory  articles  or different  regulatory  frame-
works (e.g., CRR3) would further evaluate  the models’  generalization  
capabilities  beyond  a single regulation.
Finally,  this study focuses  on a regulatory  aspect that is more 
quantitative  in nature — computing  risk weights  — while omitting  
more qualitative  aspects  that might require  different  types of reasoning.  
Future research  on these other aspects  would give insights  on LLM 
application  to financial  regulatory  implementation  more generally.  
Taken together,  this research  demonstrates  that systems  using LLMs 
for regulatory  implementation  and automation  of other regulatory  
tasks shows promise  and lays the groundwork  for further research  on 
AI-enhanced  compliance  systems.

Appendix  A. Zero-shot  CoT prompt
The zero-shot  CoT prompt  is utilized  in two variations:  once with 
the assumptions  provided  and once without  them. In each instance,  
only one test case related to exposure  class i is included  in all the 
prompts:
‘‘You are given a regulatory  text, and I want you to compute  the 
risk weight for the given input values using the regulatory  text.
The output should be an integer representing  the corresponding  risk 
weight (e.g., 20, 100) or the string ‘‘Invalid  input value!’’  if invalid 
values are detected  in input values.
Here is the regulatory  text:
