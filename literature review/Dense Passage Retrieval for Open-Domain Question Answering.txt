Abstract
Open-domain question answering relies on ef-
ﬁcient passage retrieval to select candidate
contexts, where traditional sparse vector space
models, such as TF-IDF or BM25, are the de
facto method. In this work, we show that
retrieval can be practically implemented us-
ingdense representations alone, where em-
beddings are learned from a small number
of questions and passages by a simple dual-
encoder framework. When evaluated on a
wide range of open-domain QA datasets, our
dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-
BM25 system greatly by 9%-19% absolute in
terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and
helps our end-to-end QA system establish new
state-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA
benchmarks.1
1 Introduction
Open-domain question answering (QA) (V oorhees,
1999) is a task that answers factoid questions us-
ing a large collection of documents. While early
QA systems are often complicated and consist of
multiple components (Ferrucci (2012); Moldovan
et al. (2003), inter alia ), the advances of reading
comprehension models suggest a much simpliﬁed
two-stage framework: (1) a context retriever ﬁrst
selects a small subset of passages where some
of them contain the answer to the question, and
then (2) a machine reader can thoroughly exam-
ine the retrieved contexts and identify the correct
answer (Chen et al., 2017). Although reducing
open-domain QA to machine reading is a very rea-
sonable strategy, a huge performance degradation
is often observed in practice2, indicating the needs
of improving retrieval.

1The code and trained models have been released at
https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR.
2For instance, the exact match score on SQuAD v1.1 drops
from above 80% to less than 40% (Yang et al., 2019a).Retrieval in open-domain QA is usually imple-
mented using TF-IDF or BM25 (Robertson and
Zaragoza, 2009), which matches keywords efﬁ-
ciently with an inverted index and can be seen
as representing the question and context in high-
dimensional, sparse vectors (with weighting). Con-
versely, the dense , latent semantic encoding is com-
plementary to sparse representations by design. For
example, synonyms or paraphrases that consist of
completely different tokens may still be mapped to
vectors close to each other. Consider the question
“Who is the bad guy in lord of the rings?” , which can
be answered from the context “Sala Baker is best
known for portraying the villain Sauron in the Lord
of the Rings trilogy. ” A term-based system would
have difﬁculty retrieving such a context, while
a dense retrieval system would be able to better
match “bad guy” with “villain” and fetch the cor-
rect context. Dense encodings are also learnable
by adjusting the embedding functions, which pro-
vides additional ﬂexibility to have a task-speciﬁc
representation. With special in-memory data struc-
tures and indexing schemes, retrieval can be done
efﬁciently using maximum inner product search
(MIPS) algorithms (e.g., Shrivastava and Li (2014);
Guo et al. (2016)).
However, it is generally believed that learn-
ing a good dense vector representation needs a
large number of labeled pairs of question and con-
texts. Dense retrieval methods have thus never
be shown to outperform TF-IDF/BM25 for open-
domain QA before ORQA (Lee et al., 2019), which
proposes a sophisticated inverse cloze task (ICT)
objective, predicting the blocks that contain the
masked sentence, for additional pretraining. The
question encoder and the reader model are then ﬁne-
tuned using pairs of questions and answers jointly.
Although ORQA successfully demonstrates that
dense retrieval can outperform BM25, setting new
state-of-the-art results on multiple open-domainarXiv:2004.04906v3  [cs.CL]  30 Sep 2020

QA datasets, it also suffers from two weaknesses.
First, ICT pretraining is computationally intensive
and it is not completely clear that regular sentences
are good surrogates of questions in the objective
function. Second, because the context encoder is
not ﬁne-tuned using pairs of questions and answers,
the corresponding representations could be subop-
timal.
In this paper, we address the question: can we
train a better dense embedding model using only
pairs of questions and passages (or answers), with-
outadditional pretraining? By leveraging the now
standard BERT pretrained model (Devlin et al.,
2019) and a dual-encoder architecture (Bromley
et al., 1994), we focus on developing the right
training scheme using a relatively small number
of question and passage pairs. Through a series
of careful ablation studies, our ﬁnal solution is
surprisingly simple: the embedding is optimized
for maximizing inner products of the question and
relevant passage vectors, with an objective compar-
ing all pairs of questions and passages in a batch.
OurDense Passage Retriever (DPR) is exception-
ally strong. It not only outperforms BM25 by a
large margin (65.2% vs. 42.9% in Top-5 accuracy),
but also results in a substantial improvement on
the end-to-end QA accuracy compared to ORQA
(41.5% vs. 33.3%) in the open Natural Questions
setting (Lee et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019).
Our contributions are twofold. First, we demon-
strate that with the proper training setup, sim-
ply ﬁne-tuning the question and passage encoders
on existing question-passage pairs is sufﬁcient to
greatly outperform BM25. Our empirical results
also suggest that additional pretraining may not be
needed. Second, we verify that, in the context of
open-domain question answering, a higher retrieval
precision indeed translates to a higher end-to-end
QA accuracy. By applying a modern reader model
to the top retrieved passages, we achieve compara-
ble or better results on multiple QA datasets in the
open-retrieval setting, compared to several, much
complicated systems.
2 Background
The problem of open-domain QA studied in this
paper can be described as follows. Given a factoid
question, such as “ Who ﬁrst voiced Meg on Family
Guy? ” or “ Where was the 8th Dalai Lama born? ”, a
system is required to answer it using a large corpus
of diversiﬁed topics. More speciﬁcally, we assumethe extractive QA setting, in which the answer is
restricted to a span appearing in one or more pas-
sages in the corpus. Assume that our collection
containsDdocuments, d1;d2;;dD. We ﬁrst
split each of the documents into text passages of
equal lengths as the basic retrieval units3and getM
total passages in our corpus C=fp1;p2;:::;p Mg,
where each passage pican be viewed as a sequence
of tokensw(i)

jpij. Given a question q,
the task is to ﬁnd a span w(i)
s;w(i)
s+1;;w(i)
efrom
one of the passages pithat can answer the question.
Notice that to cover a wide variety of domains, the
corpus size can easily range from millions of docu-
ments (e.g., Wikipedia) to billions (e.g., the Web).
As a result, any open-domain QA system needs to
include an efﬁcient retriever component that can se-
lect a small set of relevant texts, before applying the
reader to extract the answer (Chen et al., 2017).4
Formally speaking, a retriever R: (q;C)!CF
is a function that takes as input a question qand a
corpusCand returns a much smaller ﬁlter set of
textsCFC, wherejCFj=kjCj . For a ﬁxed
k, aretriever can be evaluated in isolation on top-k
retrieval accuracy , which is the fraction of ques-
tions for whichCFcontains a span that answers the
question.
3 Dense Passage Retriever (DPR)
We focus our research in this work on improv-
ing the retrieval component in open-domain QA.
Given a collection of Mtext passages, the goal of
our dense passage retriever (DPR) is to index all
the passages in a low-dimensional and continuous
space, such that it can retrieve efﬁciently the top
kpassages relevant to the input question for the
reader at run-time. Note that Mcan be very large
(e.g., 21 million passages in our experiments, de-
scribed in Section 4.1) and kis usually small, such
as20–100.
3.1 Overview
Our dense passage retriever (DPR) uses a dense
encoderEP()which maps any text passage to a d-
dimensional real-valued vectors and builds an index
for all theMpassages that we will use for retrieval.
3The ideal size and boundary of a text passage are func-
tions of both the retriever and reader. We also experimented
with natural paragraphs in our preliminary trials and found that
using ﬁxed-length passages performs better in both retrieval
and ﬁnal QA accuracy, as observed by Wang et al. (2019).
4Exceptions include (Seo et al., 2019) and (Roberts et al.,
2020), which retrieves andgenerates the answers, respectively.

=== Page 3 ===
At run-time, DPR applies a different encoder EQ()
that maps the input question to a d-dimensional
vector, and retrieves kpassages of which vectors
are the closest to the question vector. We deﬁne
the similarity between the question and the passage
using the dot product of their vectors:
sim(q;p) =EQ(q)|EP(p): (1)
Although more expressive model forms for measur-
ing the similarity between a question and a passage
do exist, such as networks consisting of multiple
layers of cross attentions, the similarity function
needs to be decomposable so that the represen-
tations of the collection of passages can be pre-
computed. Most decomposable similarity functions
are some transformations of Euclidean distance
(L2). For instance, cosine is equivalent to inner
product for unit vectors and the Mahalanobis dis-
tance is equivalent to L2 distance in a transformed
space. Inner product search has been widely used
and studied, as well as its connection to cosine
similarity and L2 distance (Mussmann and Ermon,
2016; Ram and Gray, 2012). As our ablation study
ﬁnds other similarity functions perform compara-
bly (Section 5.2; Appendix B), we thus choose
the simpler inner product function and improve the
dense passage retriever by learning better encoders.
Encoders Although in principle the question and
passage encoders can be implemented by any neu-
ral networks, in this work we use two independent
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) networks (base, un-
cased) and take the representation at the [CLS]
token as the output, so d= 768 .
Inference During inference time, we apply the
passage encoder EPto all the passages and index
them using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2017) ofﬂine.
FAISS is an extremely efﬁcient, open-source li-
brary for similarity search and clustering of dense
vectors, which can easily be applied to billions of
vectors. Given a question qat run-time, we derive
its embedding vq=EQ(q)and retrieve the top k
passages with embeddings closest to vq.
3.2 Training
Training the encoders so that the dot-product sim-
ilarity (Eq. (1)) becomes a good ranking function
for retrieval is essentially a metric learning prob-
lem (Kulis, 2013). The goal is to create a vector
space such that relevant pairs of questions and pas-
sages will have smaller distance (i.e., higher simi-larity) than the irrelevant ones, by learning a better
embedding function.

Positive and negative passages For retrieval
problems, it is often the case that positive examples
are available explicitly, while negative examples
need to be selected from an extremely large pool.
For instance, passages relevant to a question may
be given in a QA dataset, or can be found using the
answer. All other passages in the collection, while
not speciﬁed explicitly, can be viewed as irrelevant
by default. In practice, how to select negative ex-
amples is often overlooked but could be decisive
for learning a high-quality encoder. We consider
three different types of negatives: (1) Random: any
random passage from the corpus; (2) BM25: top
passages returned by BM25 which don’t contain
the answer but match most question tokens; (3)
Gold: positive passages paired with other questions
which appear in the training set. We will discuss the
impact of different types of negative passages and
training schemes in Section 5.2. Our best model
uses gold passages from the same mini-batch and
one BM25 negative passage. In particular, re-using
gold passages from the same batch as negatives
can make the computation efﬁcient while achiev-
ing great performance. We discuss this approach
below.
In-batch negatives Assume that we have B
questions in a mini-batch and each one is asso-
ciated with a relevant passage. Let QandPbe the
(Bd)matrix of question and passage embeddings
in a batch of size B.S=QPTis a(BB)ma-
trix of similarity scores, where each row of which
corresponds to a question, paired with Bpassages.
In this way, we reuse computation and effectively
train onB2(qi,pj) question/passage pairs in each
batch. Any ( qi,pj) pair is a positive example when
i=j, and negative otherwise. This creates Btrain-
ing instances in each batch, where there are B 1

=== Page 4 ===
negative passages for each question.
The trick of in-batch negatives has been used in
the full batch setting (Yih et al., 2011) and more
recently for mini-batch (Henderson et al., 2017;
Gillick et al., 2019). It has been shown to be an
effective strategy for learning a dual-encoder model
that boosts the number of training examples.
4 Experimental Setup
In this section, we describe the data we used for
experiments and the basic setup.
4.1 Wikipedia Data Pre-processing
Following (Lee et al., 2019), we use the English
Wikipedia dump from Dec. 20, 2018 as the source
documents for answering questions. We ﬁrst apply
the pre-processing code released in DrQA (Chen
et al., 2017) to extract the clean, text-portion of
articles from the Wikipedia dump. This step re-
moves semi-structured data, such as tables, info-
boxes, lists, as well as the disambiguation pages.
We then split each article into multiple, disjoint text
blocks of 100 words as passages , serving as our
basic retrieval units, following (Wang et al., 2019),
which results in 21,015,324 passages in the end.5
Each passage is also prepended with the title of the
Wikipedia article where the passage is from, along
with an [SEP] token.
4.2 Question Answering Datasets
We use the same ﬁve QA datasets and train-
ing/dev/testing splitting method as in previous
work (Lee et al., 2019). Below we brieﬂy describe
each dataset and refer readers to their paper for the
details of data preparation.
Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al.,
2019) was designed for end-to-end question an-
swering. The questions were mined from real
Google search queries and the answers were spans
in Wikipedia articles identiﬁed by annotators.
TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) contains a set of trivia
questions with answers that were originally scraped
from the Web.
WebQuestions (WQ) (Berant et al., 2013) consists
of questions selected using Google Suggest API,
where the answers are entities in Freebase.
CuratedTREC (TREC) (Baudi ˇs and ˇSediv `y,
2015) sources questions from TREC QA tracks
5However, Wang et al. (2019) also propose splitting docu-
ments into overlapping passages, which we do not ﬁnd advan-
tageous compared to the non-overlapping version.Dataset Train Dev Test

as well as various Web sources and is intended for
open-domain QA from unstructured corpora.
SQuAD v1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) is a popu-
lar benchmark dataset for reading comprehension.
Annotators were presented with a Wikipedia para-
graph, and asked to write questions that could be
answered from the given text. Although SQuAD
has been used previously for open-domain QA re-
search, it is not ideal because many questions lack
context in absence of the provided paragraph. We
still include it in our experiments for providing
a fair comparison to previous work and we will
discuss more in Section 5.1.
Selection of positive passages Because only
pairs of questions and answers are provided in
TREC, WebQuestions and TriviaQA6, we use the
highest-ranked passage from BM25 that contains
the answer as the positive passage. If none of the
top 100 retrieved passages has the answer, the ques-
tion will be discarded. For SQuAD and Natural
Questions, since the original passages have been
split and processed differently than our pool of
candidate passages, we match and replace each
gold passage with the corresponding passage in the
candidate pool.7We discard the questions when
the matching is failed due to different Wikipedia
versions or pre-processing. Table 1 shows the num-
ber of questions in training/dev/test sets for all the
datasets and the actual questions used for training
the retriever.
5 Experiments: Passage Retrieval
In this section, we evaluate the retrieval perfor-
mance of our Dense Passage Retriever (DPR),
along with analysis on how its output differs from
6We use the unﬁltered TriviaQA version and discard the
noisy evidence documents mined from Bing.
7The improvement of using gold contexts over passages
that contain answers is small. See Section 5.2 and Ap-
pendix A.

traditional retrieval methods, the effects of different
training schemes and the run-time efﬁciency.
The DPR model used in our main experiments
is trained using the in-batch negative setting (Sec-
tion 3.2) with a batch size of 128and one additional
BM25 negative passage per question. We trained
the question and passage encoders for up to 40
epochs for large datasets (NQ, TriviaQA, SQuAD)
and100epochs for small datasets (TREC, WQ),
with a learning rate of 10 5using Adam, linear
scheduling with warm-up and dropout rate 0:1.
While it is good to have the ﬂexibility to adapt
the retriever to each dataset, it would also be de-
sirable to obtain a single retriever that works well
across the board. To this end, we train a multi -
dataset encoder by combining training data from
all datasets excluding SQuAD.8In addition to DPR,
we also present the results of BM25, the traditional
retrieval method9and BM25+DPR, using a linear
combination of their scores as the new ranking
function. Speciﬁcally, we obtain two initial sets
of top-2000 passages based on BM25 and DPR,
respectively, and rerank the union of them using
BM25(q,p) +sim(q;p)as the ranking function.
We used= 1:1based on the retrieval accuracy in
the development set.
5.1 Main Results
Table 2 compares different passage retrieval sys-
tems on ﬁve QA datasets, using the top- kaccuracy
(k2f20;100g). With the exception of SQuAD,
DPR performs consistently better than BM25 on
all datasets. The gap is especially large when kis
small (e.g., 78.4% vs. 59.1% for top-20 accuracy
on Natural Questions). When training with mul-
8SQuAD is limited to a small set of Wikipedia documents
and thus introduces unwanted bias. We will discuss this issue
more in Section 5.1.

tiple datasets, TREC, the smallest dataset of the
ﬁve, beneﬁts greatly from more training examples.
In contrast, Natural Questions and WebQuestions
improve modestly and TriviaQA degrades slightly.
Results can be improved further in some cases by
combining DPR with BM25 in both single- and
multi-dataset settings.
We conjecture that the lower performance on
SQuAD is due to two reasons. First, the annota-
tors wrote questions after seeing the passage. As
a result, there is a high lexical overlap between
passages and questions, which gives BM25 a clear
advantage. Second, the data was collected from
only 500+ Wikipedia articles and thus the distribu-
tion of training examples is extremely biased, as
argued previously by Lee et al. (2019).
5.2 Ablation Study on Model Training
To understand further how different model training
options affect the results, we conduct several addi-
tional experiments and discuss our ﬁndings below.

=== Page 6 ===
Sample efﬁciency We explore how many train-
ing examples are needed to achieve good passage
retrieval performance. Figure 1 illustrates the top- k
retrieval accuracy with respect to different num-
bers of training examples, measured on the devel-
opment set of Natural Questions. As is shown, a
dense passage retriever trained using only 1,000 ex-
amples already outperforms BM25. This suggests
that with a general pretrained language model, it is
possible to train a high-quality dense retriever with
a small number of question–passage pairs. Adding
more training examples (from 1k to 59k) further
improves the retrieval accuracy consistently.
In-batch negative training We test different
training schemes on the development set of Natural
Questions and summarize the results in Table 3.
The top block is the standard 1-of- Ntraining set-
ting, where each question in the batch is paired
with a positive passage and its own set of nneg-
ative passages (Eq. (2)). We ﬁnd that the choice
of negatives — random, BM25 or gold passages
(positive passages from other questions) — does
not impact the top- kaccuracy much in this setting
whenk20.
The middle bock is the in-batch negative training
(Section 3.2) setting. We ﬁnd that using a similar
conﬁguration (7 gold negative passages), in-batch
negative training improves the results substantially.
The key difference between the two is whether the
gold negative passages come from the same batch
or from the whole training set. Effectively, in-batch
negative training is an easy and memory-efﬁcient
way to reuse the negative examples already in the
batch rather than creating new ones. It produces
more pairs and thus increases the number of train-
ing examples, which might contribute to the good
model performance. As a result, accuracy consis-
tently improves as the batch size grows.
Finally, we explore in-batch negative training
with additional “hard” negative passages that have
high BM25 scores given the question, but do not
contain the answer string (the bottom block). These
additional passages are used as negative passages
for all questions in the same batch. We ﬁnd that
adding a single BM25 negative passage improves
the result substantially while adding two does not
help further.
Impact of gold passages We use passages that
match the gold contexts in the original datasets
(when available) as positive examples (Section 4.2).Type #N IB Top-5 Top-20 Top-100

ditional BM25 negatives, which serve as negative pas-
sages for all questions in the batch.
Our experiments on Natural Questions show that
switching to distantly-supervised passages (using
the highest-ranked BM25 passage that contains the
answer), has only a small impact: 1 point lower
top-kaccuracy for retrieval. Appendix A contains
more details.
Similarity and loss Besides dot product, cosine
and Euclidean L2 distance are also commonly used
as decomposable similarity functions. We test these
alternatives and ﬁnd that L2 performs compara-
ble to dot product, and both of them are superior
to cosine. Similarly, in addition to negative log-
likelihood, a popular option for ranking is triplet
loss, which compares a positive passage and a nega-
tive one directly with respect to a question (Burges
et al., 2005). Our experiments show that using
triplet loss does not affect the results much. More
details can be found in Appendix B.
Cross-dataset generalization One interesting
question regarding DPR’s discriminative training
is how much performance degradation it may suf-
fer from a non-iid setting. In other words, can
it still generalize well when directly applied to
a different dataset without additional ﬁne-tuning?
To test the cross-dataset generalization, we train
DPR on Natural Questions only and test it directly
on the smaller WebQuestions and CuratedTREC
datasets. We ﬁnd that DPR generalizes well, with
3-5 points loss from the best performing ﬁne-tuned
model in top-20 retrieval accuracy (69.9/86.3 vs.
75.0/89.1 for WebQuestions and TREC, respec-
tively), while still greatly outperforming the BM25
baseline (55.0/70.9).

=== Page 7 ===
5.3 Qualitative Analysis
Although DPR performs better than BM25 in gen-
eral, passages retrieved by these two methods dif-
fer qualitatively. Term-matching methods like
BM25 are sensitive to highly selective keywords
and phrases, while DPR captures lexical variations
or semantic relationships better. See Appendix C
for examples and more discussion.
5.4 Run-time Efﬁciency
The main reason that we require a retrieval compo-
nent for open-domain QA is to reduce the number
of candidate passages that the reader needs to con-
sider, which is crucial for answering user’s ques-
tions in real-time. We proﬁled the passage retrieval
speed on a server with Intel Xeon CPU E5-2698 v4
@ 2.20GHz and 512GB memory. With the help of
FAISS in-memory index for real-valued vectors10,
DPR can be made incredibly efﬁcient, processing
995.0 questions per second, returning top 100 pas-
sages per question. In contrast, BM25/Lucene (im-
plemented in Java, using ﬁle index) processes 23.7
questions per second per CPU thread.
On the other hand, the time required for building
an index for dense vectors is much longer. Com-
puting dense embeddings on 21-million passages
is resource intensive, but can be easily parallelized,
taking roughly 8.8 hours on 8 GPUs. However,
building the FAISS index on 21-million vectors
on a single server takes 8.5 hours. In comparison,
building an inverted index using Lucene is much
cheaper and takes only about 30 minutes in total.
6 Experiments: Question Answering
In this section, we experiment with how different
passage retrievers affect the ﬁnal QA accuracy.
6.1 End-to-end QA System
We implement an end-to-end question answering
system in which we can plug different retriever
systems directly. Besides the retriever, our QA sys-
tem consists of a neural reader that outputs the
answer to the question. Given the top kretrieved
passages (up to 100in our experiments), the reader
assigns a passage selection score to each passage.
In addition, it extracts an answer span from each
passage and assigns a span score. The best span
from the passage with the highest passage selection
10FAISS conﬁguration: we used HNSW index type on CPU,
neighbors to store per node = 512, construction time search
depth = 200, search depth = 128.score is chosen as the ﬁnal answer. The passage
selection model serves as a reranker through cross-
attention between the question and the passage. Al-
though cross-attention is not feasible for retrieving
relevant passages in a large corpus due to its non-
decomposable nature, it has more capacity than the
dual-encoder model sim(q;p)as in Eq. (1). Apply-
ing it to selecting the passage from a small number
of retrieved candidates has been shown to work
well (Wang et al., 2019, 2018; Lin et al., 2018).
Speciﬁcally, let Pi2RLh(1ik) be
a BERT (base, uncased in our experiments) rep-
resentation for the i-th passage, where Lis the
maximum length of the passage and hthe hidden
dimension. The probabilities of a token being the
starting/ending positions of an answer span and a
passage being selected are deﬁned as:
Pstart;i(s) = softmax 
Piwstart
s; (3)
Pend;i(t) = softmax 
Piwend

Pselected (i) = softmax ^P|wselected
i;(5)
where ^P= [P[CLS]
1;:::;P[CLS]

wstart;wend;wselected2Rhare learnable vectors.
We compute a span score of the s-th tot-th words
from thei-th passage as Pstart;i(s)Pend;i(t), and
a passage selection score of the i-th passage as
Pselected (i).
During training, we sample one positive and
~m 1negative passages from the top 100 passages
returned by the retrieval system (BM25 or DPR)
for each question. ~mis a hyper-parameter and we
use~m= 24 in all the experiments. The training ob-
jective is to maximize the marginal log-likelihood
of all the correct answer spans in the positive pas-
sage (the answer string may appear multiple times
in one passage), combined with the log-likelihood
of the positive passage being selected. We use the
batch size of 16 for large (NQ, TriviaQA, SQuAD)
and 4 for small (TREC, WQ) datasets, and tune k
on the development set. For experiments on small
datasets under the Multi setting, in which using
other datasets is allowed, we ﬁne-tune the reader
trained on Natural Questions to the target dataset.
All experiments were done on eight 32GB GPUs.

see that higher retriever accuracy typically leads to
better ﬁnal QA results: in all cases except SQuAD,
answers extracted from the passages retrieved by
DPR are more likely to be correct, compared to
those from BM25. For large datasets like NQ and
TriviaQA, models trained using multiple datasets
(Multi) perform comparably to those trained using
the individual training set (Single). Conversely,
on smaller datasets like WQ and TREC, the multi-
dataset setting has a clear advantage. Overall, our
DPR-based models outperform the previous state-
of-the-art results on four out of the ﬁve datasets,
with 1% to 12% absolute differences in exact match
accuracy. It is interesting to contrast our results to
those of ORQA (Lee et al., 2019) and also the
concurrently developed approach, REALM (Guu
et al., 2020). While both methods include addi-
tional pretraining tasks and employ an expensive
end-to-end training regime, DPR manages to out-
perform them on both NQ and TriviaQA, simply
by focusing on learning a strong passage retrieval
model using pairs of questions and answers. The
additional pretraining tasks are likely more useful
only when the target training sets are small. Al-
though the results of DPR on WQ and TREC in the
single-dataset setting are less competitive, adding
more question–answer pairs helps boost the perfor-
mance, achieving the new state of the art.
To compare our pipeline training approach with
joint learning, we run an ablation on Natural Ques-
tions where the retriever and reader are jointlytrained, following Lee et al. (2019). This approach
obtains a score of 39.8 EM, which suggests that our
strategy of training a strong retriever and reader in
isolation can leverage effectively available supervi-
sion, while outperforming a comparable joint train-
ing approach with a simpler design (Appendix D).
One thing worth noticing is that our reader does
consider more passages compared to ORQA, al-
though it is not completely clear how much more
time it takes for inference. While DPR processes
up to 100 passages for each question, the reader
is able to ﬁt all of them into one batch on a sin-
gle 32GB GPU, thus the latency remains almost
identical to the single passage case (around 20ms).
The exact impact on throughput is harder to mea-
sure: ORQA uses 2-3x longer passages compared
to DPR (288 word pieces compared to our 100
tokens) and the computational complexity is super-
linear in passage length. We also note that we
foundk= 50 to be optimal for NQ, and k= 10
leads to only marginal loss in exact match accu-
racy (40.8 vs. 41.5 EM on NQ), which should be
roughly comparable to ORQA’s 5-passage setup.
7 Related Work
Passage retrieval has been an important compo-
nent for open-domain QA (V oorhees, 1999). It
not only effectively reduces the search space for
answer extraction, but also identiﬁes the support
context for users to verify the answer. Strong sparse
vector space models like TF-IDF or BM25 have

=== Page 9 ===
been used as the standard method applied broadly
to various QA tasks (e.g., Chen et al., 2017; Yang
et al., 2019a,b; Nie et al., 2019; Min et al., 2019a;
Wolfson et al., 2020). Augmenting text-based re-
trieval with external structured information, such
as knowledge graph and Wikipedia hyperlinks, has
also been explored recently (Min et al., 2019b; Asai
et al., 2020).
The use of dense vector representations for re-
trieval has a long history since Latent Semantic
Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990). Using labeled
pairs of queries and documents, discriminatively
trained dense encoders have become popular re-
cently (Yih et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2013; Gillick
et al., 2019), with applications to cross-lingual
document retrieval, ad relevance prediction, Web
search and entity retrieval. Such approaches com-
plement the sparse vector methods as they can po-
tentially give high similarity scores to semantically
relevant text pairs, even without exact token match-
ing. The dense representation alone, however, is
typically inferior to the sparse one. While not the
focus of this work, dense representations from pre-
trained models, along with cross-attention mecha-
nisms, have also been shown effective in passage
or dialogue re-ranking tasks (Nogueira and Cho,
2019; Humeau et al., 2020). Finally, a concurrent
work (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020) demonstrates
the feasibility of full dense retrieval in IR tasks.
Instead of employing the dual-encoder framework,
they introduced a late-interaction operator on top
of the BERT encoders.
Dense retrieval for open-domain QA has been
explored by Das et al. (2019), who propose to re-
trieve relevant passages iteratively using reformu-
lated question vectors. As an alternative approach
that skips passage retrieval, Seo et al. (2019) pro-
pose to encode candidate answer phrases as vectors
and directly retrieve the answers to the input ques-
tions efﬁciently. Using additional pretraining with
the objective that matches surrogates of questions
and relevant passages, Lee et al. (2019) jointly train
the question encoder and reader. Their approach
outperforms the BM25 plus reader paradigm on
multiple open-domain QA datasets in QA accuracy,
and is further extended by REALM (Guu et al.,
2020), which includes tuning the passage encoder
asynchronously by re-indexing the passages dur-
ing training. The pretraining objective has also
recently been improved by Xiong et al. (2020b).
In contrast, our model provides a simple and yeteffective solution that shows stronger empirical per-
formance, without relying on additional pretraining
or complex joint training schemes.
DPR has also been used as an important mod-
ule in very recent work. For instance, extending
the idea of leveraging hard negatives, Xiong et al.
(2020a) use the retrieval model trained in the pre-
vious iteration to discover new negatives and con-
struct a different set of examples in each training
iteration. Starting from our trained DPR model,
they show that the retrieval performance can be
further improved. Recent work (Izacard and Grave,
2020; Lewis et al., 2020b) have also shown that
DPR can be combined with generation models
such as BART (Lewis et al., 2020a) and T5 (Raf-
fel et al., 2019), achieving good performance on
open-domain QA and other knowledge-intensive
tasks.
8 Conclusion
In this work, we demonstrated that dense retrieval
can outperform and potentially replace the tradi-
tional sparse retrieval component in open-domain
question answering. While a simple dual-encoder
approach can be made to work surprisingly well,
we showed that there are some critical ingredients
to training a dense retriever successfully. Moreover,
our empirical analysis and ablation studies indicate
that more complex model frameworks or similarity
functions do not necessarily provide additional val-
ues. As a result of improved retrieval performance,
we obtained new state-of-the-art results on multiple
open-domain question answering benchmarks.

A Distant Supervision
When training our ﬁnal DPR model using Natural
Questions, we use the passages in our collection
that best match the gold context as the positive
passages. As some QA datasets contain only the
question and answer pairs, it is thus interesting
to see when using the passages that contain the
answers as positives (i.e., the distant supervision
setting), whether there is a signiﬁcant performance
degradation. Using the question and answer to-
gether as the query, we run Lucene-BM25 and pick
the top passage that contains the answer as the pos-
itive passage. Table 5 shows the performance of
DPR when trained using the original setting and
the distant supervision setting.
B Alternative Similarity Functions &
Triplet Loss
In addition to dot product (DP) and negative log-
likelihood based on softmax (NLL), we also exper-
iment with Euclidean distance (L2) and the triplet
loss. We negate L2 similarity scores before ap-
plying softmax and change signs of question-to-
positive and question-to-negative similarities when
applying the triplet loss on dot product scores. The
margin value of the triplet loss is set to 1. Ta-
ble 6 summarizes the results. All these additional
experiments are conducted using the same hyper-
parameters tuned for the baseline (DP, NLL).
Note that the retrieval accuracy for our “baseline”
settings reported in Table 5 (Gold) and Table 6
(DP, NLL) is slightly better than those reported in
Table 3. This is due to a better hyper-parameter
setting used in these analysis experiments, which
is documented in our code release.
C Qualitative Analysis
Although DPR performs better than BM25 in gen-
eral, the retrieved passages of these two retrievers
actually differ qualitatively. Methods like BM25
are sensitive to highly selective keywords and
phrases, but cannot capture lexical variations or se-
mantic relationships well. In contrast, DPR excels
at semantic representation, but might lack sufﬁcient
capacity to represent salient phrases which appear
rarely. Table 7 illustrates this phenomenon with
two examples. In the ﬁrst example, the top scor-
ing passage from BM25 is irrelevant, even though
keywords such as England andIreland appear mul-
tiple times. In comparison, DPR is able to returnTop-1 Top-5 Top-20 Top-100

of water” with semantic neighbors such as seaand
channel , even though no lexical overlap exists. The
second example is one where BM25 does better.
The salient phrase “Thoros of Myr” is critical, and
DPR is unable to capture it.
D Joint Training of Retriever and
Reader
We ﬁx the passage encoder in our joint-training
scheme while allowing only the question encoder
to receive backpropagation signal from the com-
bined (retriever + reader) loss function. This allows
us to leverage the HNSW-based FAISS index for
efﬁcient low-latency retrieving, without reindexing
the passages during model updates. Our loss func-
tion largely follows ORQA’s approach, which uses
log probabilities of positive passages selected from
the retriever model, and correct spans and passages
selected from the reader model. Since the passage
encoder is ﬁxed, we could use larger amount of
retrieved passages when calculating the retriever
loss. Speciﬁcally, we get top 100 passages for each
question in a mini-batch and use the method similar
to in-batch negative training: all retrieved passages’
vectors participate in the loss calculation for all
questions in a batch. Our training batch size is set
to 16, which effectively gives 1,600 passages per
question to calculate retriever loss. The reader still
uses 24 passages per question, which are selected

What is the body of water
between England and Ireland?Title:British Cycling Title: Irish Sea
. . .England is not recognised as a region by the UCI, and
there is no English cycling team outside the Commonwealth
Games. For those occasions, British Cycling selects and sup-
ports the England team. Cycling is represented on the Isle
of Man by the Isle of Man Cycling Association. Cycling in
Northern Ireland is organised under Cycling Ulster, part of
the all-Ireland governing body Cycling Ireland . Until 2006,
a rival governing body existed, . . .. . . Annual trafﬁc between Great Britain and Ireland amounts
to over 12 million passengers and of traded goods. The Irish
Sea is connected to the North Atlantic at both its northern
and southern ends. To the north, the connection is through
the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland
and the Malin Sea. The southern end is linked to the Atlantic
through the St George’s Channel between Ireland and Pem-
brokeshire, and the Celtic Sea. . . .
Who plays Thoros of Myr in
Game of Thrones?Title: No One (Game of Thrones) Title: P ˚al Sverre Hagen
. . . He may be ”no one,” but there’s still enough of a person
left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what
she’s become. Arya ﬁnally tells us something that we’ve kind
of known all along, that she’s not no one, she’s Arya Stark
of Winterfell.” ”No One” saw the reintroduction of Richard
Dormer and Paul Kaye , who portrayed Beric Dondarrion and
Thoros ofMyr , respectively, in the third season, . . .P˚al Sverre Valheim Hagen (born 6 November 1980) is a Nor-
wegian stage and screen actor. He appeared in the Norwe-
gian ﬁlm ”Max Manus” and played Thor Heyerdahl in the
Oscar-nominated 2012 ﬁlm ”Kon-Tiki”. Pl Hagen was born
in Stavanger, Norway, the son of Roar Hagen, a Norwegian
cartoonist who has long been associated with Norway ´s largest
daily, ”VG”. He lived in Jtten, a neighborhood in the city of
Stavanger in south-western Norway. . . .

from the top 5 positive and top 30 negative passages
(from the set of top 100 passages retrieved from
the same question). The question encoder’s initial
state is taken from a DPR model previously trained
on the NQ dataset. The reader’s initial state is a
BERT-base model. In terms of the end-to-end QA
results, our joint-training scheme does not provide
better results compared to the usual retriever/reader
training pipeline, resulting in the same 39.8 exact
match score on NQ dev as in our regular reader
model training.
