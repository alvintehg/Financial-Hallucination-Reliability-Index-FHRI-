ABSTRACT
Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in critical fields
such as healthcare, education, and finance due to their remarkable
proficiency in various language-related tasks. However, LLMs are
prone to generating factually incorrect responses or "hallucina-
tions," which can lead to a loss of credibility and trust among users.
To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage framework that
generates the rationale first, verifies and refines incorrect ones, and
uses them as supporting references towards generating the answer.
The generated rationale enhances the transparency of the answer
and our framework provides insights into how the model arrived at
this answer, by using this rationale and the references to the context.
In this paper, we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the
quality of responses to drug-related inquiries in the life sciences
industry. Our framework improves traditional Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) by enabling OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to be 14-25%
more faithful and 16-22% more accurate on two datasets. Further-
more, fine-tuning samples based on our framework improves the
accuracy of smaller open-access LLMs by 33-42%, and competes
with RAG on commercial models.1

1 INTRODUCTION
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural lan-
guage processing, enabling impressive advancements in various
tasks such as question-answering [ 9,12], summarization [ 12,14],
language translation [ 12], sentiment analysis [ 27], and classifica-
tion [ 12,16]. Consequently, LLMs have become a popular area of
research in recent years, and their potential applications in various
domains have garnered significant attention from both academia

1Preprint versionand industry. However, as these models have grown in scale and
complexity, they have also exhibited an alarming propensity for
generating inconsistent or fabricated information, a phenomenon
commonly referred to as hallucination [32]. This issue raises critical
concerns, particularly in applications where accuracy and reliability
are paramount. Hence, developing robust techniques to mitigate
the issue of factual inconsistencies and hallucinations in LLMs is
of prime importance.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [ 10] has shown impres-
sive results in generating grounded responses for natural language
queries, however, industrial applications often require a higher de-
gree of transparency, where the generated response must be traced
back to a source, most often available in internal databases. From
an industry perspective, we consider certain key points that are
applicable: (i) Enterprise user interactions are mostly in the form of
question and answers, (ii) Primary business use cases extend the as-
pect of traditional information retrieval with a need for an informed
response for their task and domain, (iii) The required responses are
obtainable from factually curated knowledge repositories, constitut-
ing internal documents (unstructured) and databases (structured),
or their derivatives (knowledge graphs), with an occasional need
for web retrieval, (iv) Reducing hallucination related to misrep-
resentation of facts in the response is of prime importance, and,
(v) Ability to trace back to the source of the response as a means
of interpretability and user trust. Considering the above points,
relying on the vanilla version of RAG alone will not be sufficient to
cater to the requirements of these applications.
In the life sciences industry, Pharmacovigilance [ 17] plays a cru-
cial role in public health by ensuring the post-market safety of
pharmaceuticals. This discipline involves collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data on adverse events, allowing for informed regulatory
decisions. Pubmed articles serve as a critical source of information
for drug-related inquiries. However, the vast volume of informa-
tion available can be challenging to navigate, making it difficult to
identify relevant information accurately. Using LLMs can be a prac-
tical solution here to mitigate some of the challenges and ensurearXiv:2311.13878v1  [cs.CL]  23 Nov 2023

efficient data management. This can help enhance the efficiency
and accuracy of pharmacovigilance activities, leading to improved
drug safety and better public health outcomes.
Our multi-stage framework takes all the aforementioned key
points into consideration. In our work, we:
•Propose a multi-stage framework that explicitly generates
rationales, verifies and refines incorrect ones, and uses them
as supporting references to generate accurate responses.
The framework enhances transparency and provides users
with insights into how the model arrived at the final re-
sponses, including references to the context,
•Demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in the
biomedical industry by evaluating it on two datasets: (i)
PubmedQA[ 7], a public question-answering dataset, and
(ii) Adverse-Effect-QA (AEQA), an internal expert-curated
dataset focusing on adverse drug reactions and medical
conditions specific to pharmacovigilance. Our framework
outperforms RAG by 14.1%, 15.82% in faithfulness and ac-
curacy on PubmedQA, and by 25.04%, 21.66% on our AEQA
dataset,
•Show that a fine-tuned Llama2-7B with samples following
our framework is at least 30%-40% better than non fine-
tuned versions and competes with RAG on larger commer-
cial options.
While our work in this paper focuses on improving the quality
of responses to drug-related inquiries for a life science-based ap-
plication, our framework’s effectiveness extends to other industry
applications, making it a versatile and impactful tool for organiza-
tions seeking to enhance the accuracy and transparency behind the
rationale of the generated LLM responses.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Related Work on LLM Hallucination
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative
technology in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural
Language Generation (NLG), surpassing traditional methods in
both scale and performance. Despite increased model and data
scale, state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with factual errors [ 6,19].
This has been largely attributed to LLMs memorizing vast amounts
of knowledge in their parameters through pre-training and fine-
tuning, and this phenomenon is referred to as parametric knowledge
[15,22]. This stored knowledge can lead to hallucinations if the
underlying information either gets outdated, or the LLM hidden
activations lead it towards incorrect responses during inference
[26]. [31] categorizes hallucination into input, context, and fact-
conflicting. In particular, fact-conflicting hallucination occurs when
LLMs generate text or information that contradicts established
knowledge. To mitigate this, various methods can be applied during
pre-training, fine-tuning (SFT or RLHF), or inferencing (decoding
strategies, external knowledge, exploiting uncertainty, etc.). In the
latter, existing approaches either supplement external knowledge
[18] during generation time [ 1] or use it for post-hoc correction
[2]. Existing approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) [ 10] augment LLM input with retrieved relevant passages
and demonstrations to utilize the inherent capability of In-Context
Learning (ICL) [ 3]. While RAG and its In-Context variant [ 21]have reduced factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks, industrial
applications also require explanations or the rationale behind the
responses coupled with transparency, where the generated response
must be traceable to the source, often available in their internal
data stores.
2.2 Pharmacovigilance as a case study
Pharmacovigilance encompasses the amalgamation of scientific
inquiry and associated activities focused on the identification, com-
prehension, and mitigation of potential drug-related adverse effects
or problems. Its objective is to ensure the judicious and secure ad-
ministration of medications, thereby upholding both public health
and the well-being of patients. A pivotal facet of pharmacovigilance
lies in the aggregation and scrutiny of safety-related information
pertaining to pharmaceuticals [ 17]. The underlying principle is
straightforward: in order to enhance patient outcomes, the avail-
ability of high-caliber Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reports is
of paramount importance. The generation of such reports hinges
upon proficient data collection methodologies and the capability
to analyze them. The burgeoning volume of accessible data points
represents an additional challenge for conventional Pharmacovigi-
lance. Numerous authors have articulated their apprehensions in a
publication presented by experts affiliated with the International
Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISoP) [ 4]. The expanding global pop-
ulation is anticipated to lead to an exponential surge in the inflow
of ADR-related data. Unfortunately, the methodologies employed
in traditional Pharmacovigilance are ill-equipped to manage such
a prodigious volume of data. In essence, conventional Pharma-
covigilance is projected to entail higher costs without effectively
handling the forthcoming surge in data. As many seek alternative
approaches, it appears that Large Language Models (LLM) offer
potential solutions to the predicaments confronting traditional Phar-
macovigilance. The integration of LLMs in Pharmacovigilance is
instrumental for efficient data processing. LLMs excel in analyzing
large volumes of data, particularly free-form text data prevalent
in pharmaceuticals and healthcare, ensuring more accurate data
processing. Moreover, their incorporation introduces a higher level
of automation in routine tasks, allowing professionals to focus
on higher-value objectives leading to a more refined risk-benefit
assessment for both new and existing drugs in the market. Even
though they exhibit notable advantages, Large Language Models
(LLMs) still have the limitation of occasionally producing factu-
ally inconsistent responses. In high-stakes domains such as the
pharmaceutical industry, it remains crucial to address this concern.
Our work is designed to address the issue of fact-conflicting
hallucinations during response generation. As opposed to other
sophisticated works that train or fine-tune their own LLMs, our
framework benefits existing LLMs without explicit tweaks. While
our approach is generalizable, we selected pharmacovigilance in
life sciences as our application domain, given its critical role in
ensuring the safety of pharmaceutical products and the importance
of generating accurate responses with appropriate references in
this field.

3 METHODOLOGY
Our proposed multi-stage framework (termed Factual Evidence
or FE for short) comprises five components: (i) Hybrid Retriever,
which retrieves relevant information (context) based on the user
query from various data sources such as documents, knowledge
graphs, and the internet, (ii) Prompt Engine, which takes the context
and user query as input and creates concise prompts with instruc-
tions for each component, (iii) Rationale Generator, which uses
the context and the user query to generate rationale (explanation)
with supporting evidence, (iv) Rationale Verifier, which verifies
the factual accuracy of the rationale and whether it is explicitly or
implicitly mentioned in the context, and Rationale Refiner, which
revises or refines incorrect rationale based on the context, and, (v)
Answer Generator, which utilizes the verified and refined rationale
to facilitate the LLM to generate the final descriptive response ensur-
ing factual accuracy of the answers. We describe each component
in Figure 1 in detail.
3.1 Hybrid Retriever
The Hybrid Retriever component handles both text and graph
(triplets) to efficiently retrieve relevant information from diverse
sources and formats, including indexed paragraph chunks from
documents, knowledge graphs, and the web. The retrieval system
consists of multiple retrievers, each specialized in different search
methods and data types, including semantic vectors, lexical, and
knowledge graphs. Each retriever can be used separately or in com-
bination to retrieve granular-level information from indexed data
stores. The retrieval system also includes a re-ranker that retains
only the top information based on the relevancy score. This formstheContext that is passed as input to the LLM along with the user
query and the prompt.
3.1.1 Paragraph Search. Paragraph Search retrieves information in
the form of paragraph chunks 𝑃={𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝𝑚}that are split and
indexed from a set of internal documents 𝐷={𝑑1,𝑑2,...,𝑑𝑛}. Given
a user query 𝑞, we employ both semantic and lexical techniques, to
retrieve the top 𝑘relevant paragraphs.
Semantic Search: We employ an encoder-only language model
as the retriever to obtain embeddings of the query 𝑞and perform
a semantic vector search over the data store containing embed-
ding vectors of all the paragraph chunks. Cosine similarity is used
to retrieve the top- 𝑘relevant paragraphs that are most semanti-
cally similar to the user’s query, i.e., 𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑚=𝑝𝑠𝑒𝑚 1,𝑝𝑠𝑒𝑚 2,...,𝑝𝑠𝑒𝑚 𝑘,
where𝑝𝑠𝑒𝑚 𝑖is the𝑖𝑡ℎmost semantically similar paragraph chunk
to𝑞.
Lexical Search: Here, we retrieve the top- 𝑘relevant paragraph
chunks that contain the exact word or phrase in the user’s query,
i.e.,𝑃𝑙𝑒𝑥=𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 1,𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 2,...,𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 𝑘, where𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥 𝑖is the𝑖𝑡ℎparagraph
chunk that has a match to 𝑞.
Once both search methods retrieve their top- 𝑘relevant para-
graph chunks, we use a re-ranker to provide a relevancy score for
each retrieved chunk with respect to 𝑞. The re-ranker retains only
the top-𝑃𝑘paragraph chunks based on the decreasing relevancy
scores. The weightage of lexical to semantic contribution to 𝑃𝑘is
decided based on the nature of the application. By utilizing both
Semantic Search and Lexical Search in parallel, we retrieve the most
relevant paragraph chunks that contain both semantically similar
and exact matches to the user’s query.

Muneeswaran, et al.
3.1.2 Triplet Search. Triplet Search retrieves relevant information
in the form of triplets from either Knowledge Graphs (KG) if con-
structed beforehand, or from paragraphs that are transformed into
triplets during retrieval. In the former, i.e. given a user query 𝑞and a
Knowledge Graph 𝐾𝐺, we retrieve the top 𝑘triplets𝑇=𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡𝑘
that are most relevant to the query 𝑞by utilizing a sub-graph re-
trieval algorithm [ 29] and traversing through 𝐾𝐺, taking into ac-
count the semantic relationships between the entities in 𝐾𝐺and
the query𝑞. In the latter case, i.e. given a user query 𝑞and a set of
paragraph chunks 𝑃, we retrieve the top 𝑘triplets𝑇=𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡𝑘by
processing the retrieved paragraph chunks on the fly into entities
and relations. We replace all references of a sentence with their
respective entity mentions, extract triplets, link entity mentions to
their original entities, and canonicalize the resulting triplets. This
reduces the token count for the context while maintaining a similar
performance to using the original paragraph chunks.
3.1.3 Web Search. Web Search retrieves relevant information in
the form of natural language text from the internet using selective
search engine and social media APIs. Given a user query 𝑞, we
retrieve the text of the top 𝑘web pages and API responses 𝑊=
𝑤1,𝑤2,...,𝑤𝑘that are most relevant to the query 𝑞. We also offer
the choice to users to provide a list of web pages that are whitelisted
and should be exclusively used during the retrieval process. This
helps to narrow down the search request. The obtained text is
processed into paragraph chunks on the fly using the same method
as described in Section 3.1.1. We ensure to give proper citations to
the original webpage and API source when we provide the response.
Additionally, we do not retain any information from Web Search in
our data stores.
Overall, the Hybrid Retriever combines the results of the Para-
graph, the Triplet, and the Web searches to produce a comprehen-
sive set of relevant information, i.e. the Context𝐶=Í
𝑝𝑖∈𝑃𝑘𝑤𝑖+Í
𝑡𝑖∈𝑇𝑘𝑡𝑖+Í
𝑤𝑖∈𝑊𝑘𝑝𝑖,+denoting concatenation per line, forming
the primary source of knowledge for grounding the LLM towards
generating factual responses along with the rationale and refer-
ences. Each information of the context is associated with at least
one identifier (PID-, TID-, WID-*) for (paragraph, triplet, and web)
respectively.
3.2 Prompt Engine
The Prompt Engine is a shared component responsible for convert-
ing the user query 𝑞, the retrieved context in the form of text and
triplets𝐶, along with any of the available other component out-
puts, such as the generated rationale 𝑅, and verification statements
𝑉, into a concise, predefined prompt instruction ptemplate. The
prompts are then passed to the LLM at each stage to generate the
corresponding output.
3.3 Rationale Generator
The Rationale Generator generates intermediate rationale (expla-
nations) for a given query using the retrieved context. It plays a
crucial role in guiding the LLM toward a factually grounded answer.
It also allows the user to trace back the answer to the key part of
the context, making it evidence-based and trustworthy.
Given a query 𝑞and context 𝐶=𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑘as input, the Prompt
Engine generates a prompt instruction pwhich is then fed to theLLM to identify and generate the rationale 𝑅=𝑟1,𝑟2,...,𝑟𝑘on
both implicit and explicit reasoning over each retrieved part of the
context. This is done to ensure a one-to-one mapping between the
generated set of rationale and each retrieved part of the context in
𝐶. Each explanation in 𝑅is associated with at least one identifier
(PID-, TID-, WID-*) depending on the retrieved source.
Rationale𝑅=PromptEngine(𝑞,𝐶,p(𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑒 _𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 _𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡))
3.4 Rationale Verifier and Refiner
3.4.1 Rationale Verifier. The Rationale Verifier evaluates the fac-
tualness and relevance of the generated rationale with respect to
the query and the context. Each statement in the rationale is classi-
fied into one of the below based on its relevance to the respective
identified part of the context:
•"CORRECT-EXPLICIT"
•"CORRECT-IMPLICIT"
•"CORRECT-ADDITIONAL_INFO"
•"INCORRECT-FALSE_INFO"
•"INCORRECT-DEVIATING_INFO"
•"INCORRECT-ILLOGICAL"
Given a query 𝑞, context𝐶=𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑘, and the rationale 𝑅=
𝑟1,𝑟2,...,𝑟𝑘as input, the Prompt Engine generates a prompt in-
struction pwhich is then fed to the LLM to verify and classify the
rationale𝑅into verification statements 𝑉=𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣𝑘.
Verifier𝑉=PromptEngine(𝑞,𝐶,𝑅, p(𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑒 _𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑟 _𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡))
The Rationale Verifier classifies every statement in the rationale and
offers a comprehensive justification for its categorization. Addition-
ally, it determines a verdict using the assessment criteria, labeling
the statement as either "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT." This aids
in filtering out the incorrect statements and sending them to the
Rationale Refiner.
3.4.2 Rationale Refiner. The Rationale Refiner reviews and im-
proves erroneous parts of the rationale by utilizing the justification
received from the Rationale Verifier as feedback. It assesses the
feedback along with the query and context provided and integrates
it into the revised rationale. The Rationale Refiner is an optional
component and may be skipped if there are no INCORRECT labels
from the Rationale Verifier.
Given a query 𝑞, context𝐶=𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐𝑘, rationale𝑅=𝑟1,𝑟2,...,𝑟𝑘,
and verification statements 𝑉=𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣𝑘as input, the Prompt
Engine generates a prompt instruction pwhich is then fed to the
LLM to revise the incorrect statements from 𝑅using the feedback

Refined Rationale 𝑅′=PromptEngine(𝑞,𝐶,𝑅,𝑉,

3.5 Answer Generator
The Answer Generator utilizes the meticulously verified and refined
rationale to generate a factually grounded answer for the given
query. Since we already have the rationale as support, we do not
require the full context to generate the answer. The Answer Gener-
ator also incorporates the context identifiers as citations along with
the rationale (explanation) behind each citation, allowing users to
easily cross-reference them with parts of the answer and verify the

4 EXPERIMENTS
We conducted a set of experiments to substantiate the effectiveness
of our work. These experiments encompassed a methodical com-
parison with established baselines to assess the performance and
efficacy of our approach. Our approach to retrieval is similar to that
described in [ 23]. However, our focus is on using the retrieved infor-
mation to generate effective LLM responses with rationale and not
on the hybrid retrieval component itself. We omit the experimental
details and results related to the hybrid retrieval component. We
compare our proposed approach - FE with RAG on both commercial
(OpenAI GPT 3.5-turbo and open-access (LLama-2 [25]) LLMs.
4.1 Datasets
4.1.1 PubmedQA. PubMedQA [ 8] is a biomedical question answer-
ing (QA) dataset sourced from PubMed abstracts. Its primary ob-
jective is to furnish responses to research inquiries by utilizing the
corresponding abstracts. This dataset encompasses 1,000 meticu-
lously curated, expert-annotated QA instances. Each instance com-
prises of four essential components: a question, a context denoting
the corresponding abstract, an extensive answer, and a response
categorized as either affirmative, negative, or uncertain.
4.1.2 Adverse Effect Question Answering (AEQA) Dataset. We cu-
rated an Adverse Effect Database containing 19,432 documents
related to 300 drugs through the utilization of commercially avail-
able APIs in the biomedical domain. Subsequently, we created an
evaluation dataset in collaboration with Subject Matter Experts,
who meticulously selected intricate queries and their corresponding
answers from the corpus. This finalized AEQA dataset encompasses
200 Question-Answer pairs pertaining to 40 distinct drugs, each
accompanied by a context with an average token length of 1846.4.2 Configuration
Hybrid Retrieval: The retriever was constant across all experiments,
utilizing all-base-mpnet-v2 , a fine-tuned version of the model intro-
duced by [ 24]. This approach retrieves the top 5 paragraph chunks
associated with the query.
LLM Generation: The following generation parameters were
used for all methods and models. The temperature was set to 1,
top_p as 0.95, top_k as 50 and do_sample was False.
Finetuning: We fine-tuned LLama-2-7B on samples that were gen-
erated following the prompts by our proposed multi-stage frame-
work. The dataset consists of 32k long-form question-answering
samples and is generated from the HotpotQA [ 28] dataset. We uti-
lized an effective batch size of 64, a learning rate of 3e-5, set the
maximum sequence length to 4096 and trained the model for 2
epochs. The fine-tuning was powered by Deepspeed, employing 4
A100 GPUs.
4.3 Baseline
We conducted a comparative analysis of our approach with two dif-
ferent methods, including Non-retrieval models (denoted as None),
which lack contextual information and rely solely on pre-trained
knowledge for query responses, and Retrieval-Augmented Genera-
tion (RAG) models that utilize contextual information in conjunc-
tion with the provided question. Among the benchmark models
considered were auto-regressive language models OpenAI GPT 3.5
Turbo and Meta Llama-2-7B, developed by Meta AI, employing a
transformer architecture.
4.4 Metrics
4.4.1 Evaluation. Current evaluation methods such as n-gram [ 11]
and semantic-similarity based approaches [ 30], have limitations
while assessing generative question-answering models. These meth-
ods fail to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning QA, which is in-
creasingly common as we move towards generative models from
extractive ones. Recent works [ 13] have employed GPT-4 as the pri-
mary evaluator owing to their comparable performance to human
evaluation. Since existing methods do not consider the rationale
into account, we introduce Auto-Grader, a new evaluation tech-
nique that uses GPT-4 to systematically evaluate the relevance of
rationale explanations and assign scores on a scale from 1 to 5. It

d. PID-4 states that finasteride, which is used for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia, has been shown to 
increase hair growth and decrease hair loss but there is no evidence that eflornithine hydrochloride  may have 
the opposite effect and decrease hair growth in the facts. a. CORRECT-EXPLICIT - The student accurately identifies that eflornithine hydrochloride inhibits skin 
ODC activity, which affects the rate of hair growth. This information is explicitly stated in PID-1.

d. CORRCT-IMPLICIT - The student correctly identifies that there is no logical basis provided in the facts 
to support this assumption. This information is explicitly stated in PID-4. 
GRADE: CORRECT 
Figure 2: A qualitative analysis comparing RAG vs RAG+FE illustrates the superior quality of responses from RAG+FE
also compares the generated answer to the ground truth answer,
while providing detailed justifications for each assessment. This
evaluation method is particularly useful for assessing generative
models when their answers are not explicitly derived from the pro-
vided context. The Auto-Grader also evaluates the answer as either
"CORRECT" or "INCORRECT", which can be used for calculating
accuracy. We provide the scale of grading below. Here the student
refers to the generated LLM response (and is being graded by the
teacher GPT-4):
(1)The student’s answer does not match both ground truth
and context
(2)The student’s answer does not fully match the ground truth
or the context, or it partially matches, and there may be
irrelevant information
(3)The student’s answer matches the ground truth, but par-
tially matches the context, and there may be irrelevant
information
(4)The student’s answer matches with the ground truth and
aligns well with the context, indicating a correct response
within the given context
(5)The student’s answer matches the ground truth, and it has
taken additional relevant factual information about the key
entities present in the query from the context, showcasing
a deep understanding of the topic
4.4.2 Monitoring. Monitoring real-world LLM applications is cru-
cial to ensure that the model provides accurate answers. In real-time
monitoring, the Rationale Verifier described in Section 3.4.1 can be
utilized to check whether the generated rationale adheres to the
retrieved context. Additionally, for answer generation, the Faithful-
ness metric from RAGAS [ 5] can be used for monitoring purposes,
as it only requires the query, context, and generated answer to
provide a score. The generated answer is regarded as faithful if
all the claims that are made in the answer can be inferred fromthe given context. This approach enables ongoing monitoring and
ensures the continued accuracy of the system.
4.5 Performance Comparison
Table 1 presents a comparison of the proposed framework (FE)
with RAG and No Retrieval (None) on the PubMedQA and AEQA
datasets, evaluated for Faithfulness, AutoGrading, and Accuracy
metrics. The results show that RAG+FE outperforms RAG in terms
of both faithfulness and accuracy across both datasets and models.
Faithfulness: Specifically, the highest faithful score achieved by
RAG+FE is 86.50% on the PubMedQA dataset, compared to 72.40%
for RAG. Similarly, on the AEQA dataset, RAG+FE achieves a faith-
ful score of 83.24%, which is significantly higher than RAG’s score
of 58.20%.
Accuracy : RAG+FE achieves higher accuracy than RAG across
both datasets and models. For instance, RAG+FE achieves an ac-
curacy of 88.49% on the PubMedQA dataset, compared to RAG’s
accuracy of 72.67%, resulting in a relative improvement of 15.82%.
Similarly, on the AEQA dataset, RAG+FE achieves an accuracy of
96.85%, which is significantly higher than RAG’s accuracy of 75.19%,
with a relative improvement of 21.66%. It is also observed that the
accuracy computed by Auto-Grader is closer to the Faithfulness
score, although the latter does not require the ground-truth answer
for comparison.
The results also highlight the importance of the framework on
smaller open-access models, where RAG + FE improves upon RAG.
The scores of LLama-2-7B improve after fine-tuning and RAG + FE
is comparable with the scores of vanilla RAG on GPT 3.5-turbo.
Grade Score: The main benefit of Auto-Grader is realized in
its ability to grade based on the relevance and grounding of the
response with the context. RAG+FE is better than RAG at effec-
tively utilizing context in generating high-quality explanations. As
mentioned in Section 4.4.1, a score closer to 4-5 is ideal, while a

Figure 3: Illustration showcasing the interface, functionality, and overall presentation of the implemented system
score closer to 1 indicates an incorrect answer and a lack of effec-
tive utilization of context. RAG+FE achieves higher grades than
RAG across both datasets and models, indicating its effectiveness
in generating explanations that utilize context effectively.
4.6 Qualitative Results
We provide a qualitative example of the different stages of our
framework and a comparison with RAG in Figure 2. We also provide
a screenshot of our deployed system in Figure 3.
5 ABLATION STUDY
Table 2: Ablation Study on the effect of different components
Method Accuracy (%) Faithful (%)
RAG (on Paragraphs) 65.21 75.11
RAG + FE (Paragraphs w/ direct
Rationale & Answer generation)88.43 72.73
RAG + FE (Triplets instead of
Paragraphs to reduce tokens)91.27 76.96
RAG + FE (Paragraphs w/o Ratio-
nale Verifier & Refiner)93.78 80.26
RAG + FE (Paragraphs) 96.85 83.24
Table 2 presents the results of an ablation study where different
components of the RAG + FE approach were evaluated to assess
their impact on accuracy and faithfulness.
FE outperforms vanilla RAG: The results demonstrate that all
variants of the RAG + FE approach outperform the baseline RAG
method in terms of accuracy and faithfulness.Impact of Rationale Verifier and Refiner: Comparing para-
graph retrieval experiments, the approach that uses the Rationale
Verifier and Rationale Refiner achieves the highest accuracy of
96.85% and the highest faithful score of 83.24%. This suggests that
verification and refinement lead to high-quality rationale and im-
prove overall performance.
Step-by-step vs direct generation: Although the direct gen-
eration of both rationale and answer together is better than RAG
alone, we observed better performance when done in a step-wise
fashion, as there is a relative improvement of 8.42%, 10.51% in terms
of accuracy and faithfulness scores in terms of the latter.
Paragraphs vs Triplets : We experimented with triplets instead
of paragraphs to reduce the context length of the input, reducing
the average token length from 1846 to 285. While the number of
tokens is reduced by 6.5x and can benefit downstream applications
with limited computational resources, it has lower faithfulness
and accuracy scores compared to the variant that uses paragraphs.
Therefore, the choice of input representation should be made based
on the specific requirements of the downstream application and
the trade-offs between accuracy, faithfulness, and input length.
6 INDUSTRY IMPACT
Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the relia-
bility and credibility of LLMs in real-world industrial applications
and extends beyond the previously demonstrated application in
Pharmacovigilance. Domains where factual evidence for a response
is essential include Legal, Finance (BFSI) and Education where the
accuracy and transparency of a response is of utmost importance.
Moreover, this framework alleviates the burden and time required
by the user to double-check if a response is factually consistent. As
this technology matures, its potential to revolutionize industries

is evident, promising a safer and more efficient landscape for all
stakeholders involved.
7 CONCLUSION
We presented an approach to address the problem of hallucina-
tions in LLMs by getting more accurate and plausible responses
whilst providing a transparent explanation for the LLM’s decisions.
Furthermore, we have also demonstrated the applicability of our
solution in the field of Pharmacovigilance, where ensuring the fac-
tualness of LLM responses is crucial. Through our quantitative
and qualitative results, we have showcased how our approach can
enhance the quality of responses for drug-related queries, such
as identifying adverse drug reactions and providing precise and
well-sourced explanations for the model’s decision-making process.
Our approach can be adopted by researchers and practitioners who
are interested in combating factual hallucinations in LLMs.
