Algorithm Aversion: People Erroneously Avoid AlgorithmsAfter Seeing Them ErrBerkeley J. Dietvorst, Joseph P. Simmons, and Cade MasseyUniversity of PennsylvaniaResearch shows that evidence-based algorithms more accurately predict the future than do humanforecasters. Yet when forecasters are deciding whether to use a human forecaster or a statisticalalgorithm, they often choose the human forecaster. This phenomenon, which we callalgorithm aversion,is costly, and it is important to understand its causes. We show that people are especially averse toalgorithmic forecasters after seeing them perform, even when they see them outperform a humanforecaster. This is because people more quickly lose confidence in algorithmic than human forecastersafter seeing them make the same mistake. In 5 studies, participants either saw an algorithm makeforecasts, a human make forecasts, both, or neither. They then decided whether to tie their incentives tothe future predictions of the algorithm or the human. Participants who saw the algorithm perform wereless confident in it, and less likely to choose it over an inferior human forecaster. This was true evenamong those who saw the algorithm outperform the human.Keywords:decision making, decision aids, heuristics and biases, forecasting, confidenceSupplemental materials:http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000033.suppImagine that you are an admissions officer for a university andit is your job to decide which student applicants to admit to yourinstitution. Because your goal is to admit the applicants who willbe most likely to succeed, this decision requires you to forecaststudents’ success using the information in their applications. Thereare at least two ways to make these forecasts. The more traditionalway is for you to review each application yourself and make aforecast about each one. We refer to this as thehuman method.Alternatively, you could rely on an evidence-based algorithm1tomake these forecasts. For example, you might use the data of paststudents to construct a statistical model that provides a formula forcombining each piece of information in the students’ applications.We refer to this as thealgorithm method.Research comparing the effectiveness of algorithmic and humanforecasts shows that algorithms consistently outperform humans.In his bookClinical Versus Statistical Prediction: A TheoreticalAnalysis and Review of the Evidence, Paul Meehl (1954) reviewedresults from 20 forecasting studies across diverse domains, includ-ing academic performance and parole violations, and showed thatalgorithms outperformed their human counterparts.Dawes subse-quently gathered a large body of evidence showing that humanexperts did not perform as well as simple linear models at clinicaldiagnosis, forecasting graduate students’ success, and other predictiontasks (Dawes, 1979; Dawes, Faust, & Meehl, 1989). Following thiswork, Grove, Zald, Lebow, Snitz, and Nelson (2000) meta-analyzed136 studies investigating the prediction of human health and behavior.They found that algorithms outperformed human forecasters by 10%on average and that it was far more common for algorithms tooutperform human judges than the opposite. Thus, across the vastmajority of forecasting tasks, algorithmic forecasts are more accuratethan human forecasts (see also Silver, 2012).If algorithms are better forecasters than humans, then peopleshould choose algorithmic forecasts over human forecasts. How-ever, they often don’t. In a wide variety of forecasting domains,experts and laypeople remain resistant to using algorithms, oftenopting to use forecasts made by an inferior human rather thanforecasts made by a superior algorithm. Indeed, research showsthat people often prefer humans’ forecasts to algorithms’ forecasts(Diab, Pui, Yankelevich, & Highhouse, 2011; Eastwood, Snook, &Luther, 2012), more strongly weigh human input than algorithmicinput (Önkal, Goodwin, Thomson, Gönül, & Pollock, 2009; Prom-berger & Baron, 2006), and more harshly judge professionals whoseek out advice from an algorithm rather than from a human(Shaffer, Probst, Merkle, Arkes, & Medow, 2013).This body of research indicates that people often exhibit what werefer to asalgorithm aversion.H o w e v e r ,i td o e sn o te x p l a i nw h e npeople use human forecasters instead of superior algorithms, or whypeople fail to use algorithms for forecasting. In fact, we know verylittle about when and why people exhibit algorithm aversion.1We use the term “algorithm” to encompass any evidence-based fore-casting formula or rule. Thus, the term includes statistical models, decisionrules, and all other mechanical procedures that can be used for forecasting.Berkeley J. Dietvorst, Joseph P.

Although scholars have written about this question, most of thewritings are based on anecdotal experience rather than empiricalevidence.2Some of the cited reasons for the cause of algorithmaversion include the desire for perfect forecasts (Dawes, 1979;Einhorn, 1986; Highhouse, 2008), the inability of algorithms tolearn (Dawes, 1979), the presumed ability of human forecasters toimprove through experience (Highhouse, 2008), the notion thatalgorithms are dehumanizing (Dawes, 1979; Grove & Meehl,1996), the notion that algorithms cannot properly consider indi-vidual targets (Grove & Meehl, 1996), concerns about the ethical-ity of relying on algorithms to make important decisions (Dawes,1979), and the presumed inability of algorithms to incorporatequalitative data (Grove & Meehl, 1996). On the one hand, thesewritings offer thoughtful and potentially viable hypotheses aboutwhy algorithm aversion occurs. On the other hand, the absence ofempirical evidence means that we lack real insight into which ofthese (or other) reasons actually drive algorithm aversion and,thus, when people are most likely to exhibit algorithm aversion. Byidentifying an important driver of algorithm aversion, our researchbegins to provide this insight.A Cause of Algorithm AversionImagine that you are driving to work via your normal route. Yourun into traffic and you predict that a different route will be faster.You get to work 20 minutes later than usual, and you learn from acoworker that your decision to abandon your route was costly; thetraffic was not as bad as it seemed. Many of us have made mistakeslike this one, and most would shrug it off. Very few people woulddecide to never again trust their own judgment in such situations.Now imagine the same scenario, but instead ofyouhaving wronglydecided to abandon your route, your traffic-sensitive GPS made theerror. Upon learning that the GPS made a mistake, many of us wouldlose confidence in the machine, becoming reluctant to use it again inas i m i l a rs i t u a t i o n .I ts e e m st h a tt h ee r r o r st h a tw et o l e r a t ei nh u m a n sbecome less tolerable when machines make them.We believe that this example highlights a general tendency forpeople to more quickly lose confidence in algorithmic than humanforecasters after seeing them make the same mistake. We proposethat this tendency plays an important role in algorithm aversion. Ifthis is true, then algorithm aversion should (partially) hinge onpeople’s experience with the algorithm. Although people may bewilling to trust an algorithm in the absence of experience with it,seeing it perform—and almost inevitably err—will cause them toabandon it in favor of a human judge. This may occur even whenpeople see the algorithm outperform the human.We test this in five studies. In these studies, we asked partici-pants to predict real outcomes from real data, and they had todecide whether to bet on the accuracy of human forecasts or theaccuracy of forecasts made by a statistical model. We manipulatedparticipants’ experience with the two forecasting methods prior tomaking this decision. In the control condition, they had no expe-rience with either the human or the model. In the human condition,they saw the results of human forecasts but not model forecasts. Inthe model condition, they saw the results of model forecasts butnot human forecasts. Finally, in the model-and-human condition,they saw the results ofboththe human and model forecasts.Even though the model is superior to the humans—it outper-forms the humans in all of the studies—experience reveals that itis not perfect and therefore makes mistakes. Because we expectedpeople to lose confidence in the model after seeing it makemistakes, we expected them to choose the model much less oftenin the conditions in which they saw the model perform (the modeland model-and-human conditions) than in those in which they didnot (the control and human conditions). In sum, we predicted thatpeople’s aversion to algorithms would be increased by seeing themperform (and therefore err), even when they saw the algorithmsmake less severe errors than a human forecaster.Overview of StudiesIn this article, we show that people’s use of an algorithmicversus a human forecaster hinges on their experience with thosetwo forecasters. In five studies, we demonstrate that seeing analgorithm perform (and therefore err) makes people less likely touse it instead of a human forecaster. We show that this occurs evenfor those who have seen the algorithm outperform the human, andregardless of whether the human forecaster is the participantherself or another, anonymous participant.In all of our studies, participants were asked to use real data toforecast real outcomes. For example, in Studies 1, 2, and 4,participants were given master’s of business administration(MBA) admissions data from past students and asked to predicthow well the students had performed in the MBA program. Nearthe end of the experiment, we asked them to choose which of twoforecasting methods to rely on to make incentivized forecasts—ahuman judge (either themselves, in Studies 1–3, or another partic-ipant, in Study 4) or a statistical model that we built using the samedata given to participants. Prior to making this decision, we ma-nipulated whether participants witnessed the algorithm’s perfor-mance, the human’s performance, both, or neither.Because the methods and results of these five studies are similar,we first describe the methods of all five studies and then reveal theresults. For each study, we report how we determined our samplesize, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all mea-sures. The exact materials and data are available in the onlinesupplemental materials.MethodParticipantsWe conducted Studies 1, 2, and 4 in the Wharton School’sBehavioral Lab. Participants received a $10 show-up fee for anhour-long session of experiments, of which ours was a 20-mincomponent, and they could earn up to an additional $10 foraccurate forecasting performance. In Study 1, we recruited asmany participants as we could in 2 weeks; in Study 2 we recruitedas many as we could in 1 week; and in Study 4, each participantwas yoked to a different participant from Study 1, and so wedecided to recruit exactly as many participants as had fully com-pleted every question in Study 1. In Studies 1, 2, and 4, 8, 4, and0 participants, respectively, exited the survey before completingthe study’s key dependent measure, leaving us with final samples2One exception is the work of Arkes, Dawes, and Christensen (1986),who found that domain expertise diminished people’s reliance on algorith-mic forecasts (and led to worse performance).This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.2DIETVORST, SIMMONS, AND MASSEY

of 361, 206, and 354. These samples averaged 21–24 years of ageand were 58–62% female.We conducted Studies 3a and 3b using participants from theAmazon.com Mechanical Turk (MTurk) Web site. Participantsreceived $1 for completing the study and they could earn up to anadditional $1 for accurate forecasting performance. In Study 3a,we decided in advance to recruit 400 participants (100 per condi-tion), and in Study 3b, we decided to recruit 1,000 participants(250 per condition). In both studies, participants who responded tothe MTurk posting completed a question before they started thesurvey to ensure that they were reading instructions. We pro-grammed the survey to exclude any participants who failed thischeck (77 in Study 3a and 217 in Study 3b), and some participantsdid not complete the key dependent measure (70 in Study 3a and187 in Study 3b). This left us with final samples of 410 in Study3a and 1,036 in Study 3b. These samples averaged 33–34 years ofage and were 46–53% female.ProceduresOverview.This section describes the procedures of each ofthe five studies, beginning with a detailed description of Study 1and then briefer descriptions of the ways in which Studies 2–4differed from Study 1.

After giving their consent and entering their Wharton Behav-ioral Lab ID number, participants were introduced to the experi-mental judgment task. Participants were told that they would playthe part of an MBA admissions officer and that they wouldevaluate real MBA applicants using their application information.Specifically, they were told that it was their job to forecast theactual success of each applicant, where success was defined as anequal weighting of GPA, respect of fellow students (assessed viaa survey), prestige of employer upon graduation (as measured in anTable 1Studies 1, 2, and 4: Belief and Confidence MeasuresStudy 1 Study 2 Study 4How much bonus money do you think you would earn if your own estimates determined your bonus?

annual poll of MBA students around the Unites States), and jobsuccess 2 years after graduation (measured by promotions andraises).Participants were then told that the admissions office had cre-ated a statistical model that was designed to forecast studentperformance. They were told that the model was based on hun-dreds of past students, using the same data that the participantswould receive, and that the model was sophisticated, “put togetherby thoughtful analysts.”3Participants were further told that themodel was designed to predict each applicant’s percentile amonghis or her classmates according to the success criteria describedabove, and a brief explanation of percentiles was provided toensure that participants understood the prediction task. Finally,participants received detailed descriptions of the eight variablesthat they would receive about each applicant (undergraduate de-gree, GMAT scores, interview quality, essay quality, work expe-rience, average salary, and parents’ education) before making theirforecasts. Figure 1 shows an example of what participants sawwhen making their forecasts.The rest of the study proceeded in two stages. In the first stage,participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions,which either gave them experience with the forecasting perfor-mance of the model (model condition), themselves (human con-dition), both the model and themselves (model-and-human condi-tion), or neither (control condition). The three treatment conditions(human, model, model-and-human) were informed that they wouldnext make (or see) 15 forecasts, and the control condition (n/H1100591)skipped this stage of the survey altogether. Participants in themodel-and-human condition (n/H1100590) learned that, for each of the15 applicants, they would make their own forecast, and then getfeedback showing their own prediction, the model’s prediction,and the applicant’s true percentile. Participants in the humancondition (n/H1100590) learned that they would make a forecast andthen get feedback showing their own prediction and the applicant’strue percentile. Participants in the model condition (n/H1100590)learned that they would get feedback showing the model’s predic-tion and the applicant’s true percentile. After receiving theseinstructions, these participants proceeded through the 15 forecasts,receiving feedback after each one. They were not incentivized foraccurately making these forecasts. The 15 forecasted applicantswere randomly selected (without replacement) from a pool of 115applicants, and thus varied across participants.Next, in the second stage of the survey, all participants learnedthat they would make 10 “official” incentivized estimates, earningan extra $1 each time the forecast they used was within 5 percen-tiles of an MBA student’s realized percentile. To be sure theyunderstood this instruction, participants were required to type thefollowing sentence into a text box before proceeding: “You willreceive a $1 bonus for each of your 10 estimates that is within 5percentiles of a student’s true percentile. Therefore, you can earnan extra $0 to $10, depending on your performance.”We then administered the study’s key dependent measure. Par-ticipants were told that they could choose to have either their ownforecasts or the model’s forecasts determine their bonuses for the10 incentivized estimates. They were then asked to choose be-tween the two methods by answering the question “Would you likeyour estimates or the model’s estimates to determine your bonusesfor all 10 rounds?” The two response options were “Use only thestatistical model’s estimates to determine my bonuses for all 10rounds” and “Use only my estimates to determine my bonuses forall 10 rounds.” We made it very clear to participants that theirchoice of selecting either the model or themselves would apply toall 10 of the forecasts they were about to make.After choosing between themselves and the algorithm, partici-pants forecasted the success of 10 randomly chosen applicants(excluding those they were exposed to in the first stage, if any). Allparticipants made a forecast and then saw the model’s forecast for10 randomly selected MBA applicants.4They received no feed-back about their own or the model’s performance while complet-ing these forecasts.After making these forecasts, participants answered questionsdesigned to assess their confidence in, and beliefs about, the modeland themselves (see Table 1 for the list of questions). Finally,participants learned their bonus and reported their age, gender, andhighest level of education.Study 2.In Study 2, we conducted a closer examination of ourmost interesting experimental condition—the “model-and-human”condition in which participants saw both the human and the modelperform before deciding which forecasting method to bet on. Wewanted to see if the model-and-human condition’s tendency to tietheir incentives to their own forecasts would replicate in a largersample. We also wanted to see whether it would be robust tochanges in the incentive structure, and to knowing during the firststage, when getting feedback on both the model’s and their ownperformance, what the incentive structure would be.This study’s procedure was the same as that of Study 1, exceptfor five changes. First, all participants were assigned to the model-and-human condition. Second, participants were randomly as-signed to one of three types of bonuses in the experiment’s secondstage. Participants were either paid $1 each time their forecast waswithin 5 percentiles of an MBA student’s realized percentile(5-percentile condition;n/H1100570), paid $1 each time their forecastwas within 20 percentiles of an MBA student’s realized percen-tile (20-percentile condition;n/H1100569), or paid based on theiraverage absolute error (AAE condition;n/H1100567). Participants whowere paid based on average absolute error earned $10 if theiraverage absolute error was/H113494, and this bonus decreased by $1 foreach four additional units of average error. This payment rule isreproduced in Appendix A.3The statistical model was built using the same data provided to par-ticipants and is described in the supplemental materials.4For all five studies, after each Stage 2 trial participants guessed if theirestimate or the model’s was closer to the true value after seeing the model’sforecast. This measure was exploratory and we do not discuss it further.

Third, unlike in Study 1, participants learned this payment rulejust before making the 15 unincentivized forecasts in the firststage. Thus, they were fully informed about the payment rule whileencoding their own and the model’s performance during the first15 trials. We implemented this design feature in Studies 3a and 3bas well.Fourth, participants completed a few additional confidence andbelief measures, some of which were asked immediately beforethey completed their Stage 2 forecasts (see Table 1). Participantsalso answered an exploratory block of questions asking them torate the relative competencies of the model and themselves on anumber of specific attributes. This block of questions, which wasalso included in the remaining studies, is listed in Table 7.Study 3a.Study 3a examined whether the results of Study 1would replicate in a different forecasting domain and when themodel outperformed participants’ forecasts by a much wider mar-gin. As in Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to one offour conditions—model (n/H11005101), human (n/H11005105), model-and-human (n/H1100599), and control (n/H11005105)—which determinedwhether, in the first stage of the experiment, they saw the model’sforecasts, made their own forecasts, both, or neither.The Study 3a procedure was the same as Study 1 except for afew changes. Most notably, the forecasting task was different. TheStudy 3a forecasting task involved predicting the rank (1 to 50) ofindividual U.S. states in terms of the number of airline passengersthat departed from that state in 2011. A rank of 1 indicates that thestate had the most departing airline passengers, and a rank of 50indicates that it had the least departing airline passengers.To make each forecast, participants received the followingpieces of information about the state: its number of major airports(as defined by the Bureau of Transportation), its 2010 censuspopulation rank (1 to 50), its total number of counties rank (1 to50), its 2008 median household income rank (1 to 50), and its 2009domestic travel expenditure rank (1 to 50). Figure 2 shows anexample of the stimuli used in this study. All of the stimuli thatparticipants saw during the experiment were randomly selectedwithout replacement from a pool of the 50 U.S. states. The statis-tical model was built using airline passenger data from 2006 to2010 and the same variables provided to participants; it is de-scribed in more detail in the supplemental materials.There were five other procedural differences between Study 3aand Study 1. First, participants who were not in the controlcondition completed 10 unincentivized forecasts instead of 15 inthe first stage of the experiment. Second, in the second stage of thestudy, all participants completed one incentivized forecast insteadof 10. Thus, their decision about whether to bet on the model’sforecast or their own pertained to the judgment of a single state.Third, we used a different payment rule to determine partici-pants’ bonuses for that forecast. Participants were paid $1 if theymade a perfect forecast. This bonus decreased by $0.15 for eachadditional unit of error associated with their estimate. This pay-ment rule is reproduced in Appendix B. Fourth, as in Study 2,participants learned this payment rule before starting the first stageof unincentivized forecasts instead of after that stage. Finally, asshown in Tables 2 and 7, the measures that we asked participantsto complete were slightly different.Study 3b.Study 3b was a higher-powered direct replication ofStudy 3a.5Except for some differences in the measures that wecollected, and in the timing of those measures (see Table 2), theprocedures of Studies 3a and 3b were identical.Study 4.The previous studies investigated whether people aremore likely to use theirownforecasts after seeing an algorithmperform. In Study 4, we investigated whether this effect extends tochoices between an algorithm’s forecasts and the forecasts of adifferent person.The procedure for this experiment was identical to that of Study1, except that participants chose between a past participant’sforecasts and the model’s instead of between their own forecastsand the model’s. Each participant was yoked to a unique partici-pant from Study 1 and, thus, assigned to the same condition as thatparticipant: either control (n/H1100588), human (n/H1100587), model (n/H1100590), or model-and-human (n/H1100589). Study 4 participants sawexactly the same sequence of information that the matched partic-ipant had seen, including the exact same 15 forecasting outcomesin Stage 1. For example, Study 4 participants who were matchedwith a Study 1 participant who was in the model-and-humancondition saw that participant’s Stage 1 forecasts and saw exactlythe same model forecasts that that participant had seen. FollowingStage 1, all participants decided whether to tie their Stage 2forecasting bonuses to the model’s forecasts or to the forecasts ofthe Study 1 participant they were matched with.As shown in Table 1, Study 4 participants completed the samemeasures asked in Study 1. In addition, as in Studies 2, 3a, and 3b,they also answered the block of questions asking them to comparethe human forecaster to the model, though in this study thequestions required a comparison between the model and the par-ticipant they were matched with, rather than a comparison betweenthe model and themselves (see Table 7).Results and DiscussionForecasting PerformanceAs expected, the model outperformed participants in all fivestudies. As shown in Table 3, participants would have earnedsignificantly larger bonuses if they had tied their bonuses to thestatistical model’s forecasts than if they had tied their bonuses tothe human’s forecasts. Moreover, the model’s forecasts were muchmore highly correlated with realized outcomes than were humans’forecasts (r/H11005.53 vs.r/H11005.16, in the MBA student forecasting task;r/H11005.92 vs.r/H11005.69, in the airline passenger forecasting task). Interms of average absolute error, the human forecasters produced5As described in the supplemental materials, the replication attempt ofStudy 3b was motivated by having observed some weaker results in similarstudies run prior to Study 3a. This study ensured that the Study 3a findingswere not due to chance.

15–29% more error than the model in the MBA student forecastingtask of Studies 1, 2, and 4 and 90–97% more error than the modelin the airline passenger forecasting task of Studies 3a and 3b (seeTable 3). This was true in both the stage 1 and stage 2 forecasts.Thus, participants in the model-and-human condition, who sawboth the model and the human perform in stage 1, were much morelikely to see the model outperform the human than to see theopposite, and this was especially true in Studies 3a and 3b. Par-ticipants in every condition in every study were better off choosingthe model over the human.Main AnalysesWe hypothesized that seeing the model perform, and thereforeerr, would decrease participants’ tendency to bet on it rather thehuman forecaster, despite the fact that the model was more accu-rate than the human. As shown in Figure 3, this effect wasobserved, and highly significant, in all four studies in which wemanipulated experience with the model. In Study 1, we observedthis effect in lab participants’ forecasts of MBA students’ perfor-mance. In Studies 3a and 3b, we learned that this effect generalizesto a different forecasting task—predicting states’ ranks in numberof departing airline passengers—and, importantly, to a context inwhich the model dramatically outperforms the human forecasters,producing abouthalfas much error in these two studies. Althoughsome magnitude of advantage must lead participants who see thealgorithm perform to be more likely to choose it—for example, ifthey were to see the algorithm predict all outcomes exactly right—the model’s large advantage in these studies was not large enoughto get them to do so. Finally, Study 4 teaches us that the effectextends to choices between the model and a different human judge.In sum, the results consistently support the hypothesis that seeingan algorithm perform makes people less likely to choose it.Interestingly, participants in the model-and-human conditions,most of whom saw the model outperform the human in the firststage of the experiment (610 of 741 [83%] across the five studies),were, across all studies, among thoseleastlikely to choose themodel.6In every experiment, participants in the model-and-humancondition were significantly less likely to tie their bonuses to themodel than were participants who did not see the model perform.This result is not limited to the minority who saw the humanoutperform the model, as even those who saw the model outper-form the human were less likely to choose the model than wereparticipants who did not see the model perform.7In addition, theresults of Study 2, in which all participants were assigned to themodel-and-human condition, teach us that the aversion to the modelin this condition persists within a large sample, and is not contingenton the incentive structure.Figure 3 also shows that although seeing the model perform, andtherefore err, decreased the tendency to choose the model, seeingthe human perform, and therefore err, didnotsignificantly de-crease the tendency to choose the human. This suggests, as hy-pothesized, that people are quicker to abandon algorithms thatmake mistakes than to abandon humans that make mistakes, eventhough, as is often the case, the humans’ mistakes were larger.Figure 3 reveals additional findings of interest. First, althoughall three of the Study 2 incentive conditions showed the hypoth-esized aversion to using the algorithm, the magnitude of thisaversion did differ across conditions,/H92732(2,N/H11005206)/H110058.50,p/H110056When we say that the model “outperformed” the human, we mean thatacross the trials in the first stage of the experiment, the average absolutedeviation between the model’s forecasts and the true percentiles wassmaller than the average absolute deviation between the human’s forecastsand the true percentiles.7With all model-and-human condition participants included, the statisticaltests are as follows: Study 1,/H92732(1,N/H11005271)/H1100539.94,p/H11021.001; Study 3a,/H92732(1,N/H11005309)/H110054.72,p/H11005.030; Study 3b,/H92732(1,N/H11005783)/H1100516.83,p/H11021.001; Study 4,/H92732(1,N/H11005264)/H1100513.84,p/H11021.001.

.014. Participants who were paid for providing forecasts within 20percentiles of the correct answer were less likely to choose themodel than were participants who were paid for providing fore-casts within 5 percentiles of the correct answer,/H92732(1,N/H11005139)/H110053.56,p/H11005.059, as well as participants whose payment was basedon the average absolute error,/H92732(1,N/H11005136)/H110058.56,p/H11005.003.8As correct predictions were easier to obtain in the 20-percentilecondition, this effect likely reflects people’s greaterrelativecon-fidence in their own forecasts when forecasts are easy than whenthey are difficult (e.g., Heath & Tversky, 1991; Kruger, 1999;Moore & Healy, 2008). In support of this claim, although partic-ipants’ confidence in themodel’sforecasting ability did not differbetween the 20-percentile (M/H110052.84,SD/H110050.80) and otherpayment conditions (M/H110052.73,SD/H110050.85),t(203)/H110050.92,p/H11005.360, they were significantly more confident in theirownforecast-ing ability in the 20-percentile condition (M/H110053.20,SD/H110050.85)than in the other payment conditions (M/H110052.67,SD/H110050.85),t(203)/H110054.24,p/H11021.001. Moreover, follow-up analyses revealedthat the effect of the 20-percentile incentive on preference for themodel was mediated by confidence in their own forecasts, but notby confidence in the model’s forecasts.98The 5-percentile and AAE conditions did not differ,/H92732(1,N/H11005137)/H110051.21,p/H11005.271.

Additionally, although one must be cautious about making com-parisons across experiments, Figure 3 also shows that, acrossconditions, participants were more likely to bet on the modelagainst another participant (Study 4) than against themselves(Study 1). This suggests that algorithm aversion may be morepronounced among those whose forecasts the algorithm threatensto replace.ConfidenceParticipants’ confidence ratings show an interesting pattern, onethat suggests that participants “learned” more from the model’smistakes than from the human’s (see Table 4). Whereas seeing thehuman perform did not consistently decrease confidence in thehuman’s forecasts—it did so significantly only in Study 4, seeingthe model perform significantly decreased participants’ confidencein the model’s forecasts in all four studies.10Thus, seeing a modelmake relatively small mistakes consistently decreased confidencein the model, whereas seeing a human make relatively largemistakes did not consistently decrease confidence in the human.We tested whether confidence in the model’s or human’s fore-casts significantly mediated the effect of seeing the model performon participants’ likelihood of choosing the model over the human.We conducted binary mediation analyses, setting choice of themodel or the human as the dependent variable (0/H11005chose to tietheir bonus to the human; 1/H11005chose to tie their bonus to themodel), whether or not participants saw the model perform asthe independent variable (0/H11005control or human condition; 1/H11005model or model-and-human condition), and confidence in thehuman’s forecasts and confidence in the model’s forecasts asmediators. Weused Preacher and Hayes’s (2008) bootstrappingprocedure to obtain unbiased 95% confidence intervals around themediated effects. In all cases, confidence in the model’s forecastssignificantly mediated the effect, whereas confidence in the humandid not.11It is interesting that reducing confidence in the model’s forecastsseems to have led participants to abandon it, because participantswho saw the model perform werenotmore confident in thehuman’s forecasts than in the model’s. Whereas participants in thecontrol and human conditions were more confident in the model’sforecasts than in the human’s, participants in the model and model-and-human conditions were about equally confident in the model’sand human’s forecasts (see Table 4). Yet, in our studies, they choseto tie their forecasts to the human most of the time.Figure 4 explores this further, plotting the relationship betweenchoosing the statistical model and differences in confidence in themodel’s forecasts versus the human’s forecasts. There are a fewthings to note.First, passing the sanity check, people who were moreconfident in the model’s forecasts than in the human’s forecasts weremore likely to tie their bonuses to the model’s forecasts, whereaspeople who were more confident in the human’s forecasts than in themodel’s forecasts were more likely to tie their bonuses to the human’sforecasts.More interestingly, the majority of people who wereequallyconfident in the model’s and human’s forecasts chose to tietheir bonuses to the human’s forecasts, particularly when they hadseen the model perform. It seems that most people will choose thestatistical model over the human only when they are more confi-dent in the model than in the human.Finally, the divergent lines in Figure 4 show that the effect ofseeing the model perform on participant’s choice of the modelis not fully accounted for by differences in confidence. Partic-ipants who expressed less confidence in the model’s forecaststhan in the human’s forecasts were, unsurprisingly, relativelyunlikely to tie their bonuses to the model, but this was morepronounced for those saw the model perform. This differencemay occur because expressions of confidence in the model’sforecasts are less meaningful without seeing the model perform,10Seeing the model perform significantly decreased confidence in themodel’s forecasts in every study: Study 1,t(358)/H110056.69,p/H11021.001; Study3a,t(403)/H110052.19,p/H11005.029; Study 3b,t(1,032)/H110057.16,p/H11021.001; Study4,t(351)/H110055.12,p/H11021.001.

or because the confidence measure may fail to fully capturepeople’s disdain for a model that they see err. Whatever thecause, it is clear that seeing the model perform reduces thelikelihood of choosing the model, over and above the effect ithas on reducing confidence.BeliefsIn addition to measuring confidence in the model’s and human’sforecasts, we also measured beliefs about the model’s and human’sforecasts. As shown in Tables 5 and 6, the results of these beliefmeasures are similar to the results of the confidence measures:With few exceptions, seeing the model perform made participantsless optimistic about the model. For example, Study 1 participantswho saw the model perform were significantly less likely tobelieve that the model would be within 5 percentiles of the rightanswer than were participants who did not see the model perform.And Study 3b participants who saw the model perform thought itwould make fewer perfect predictions than participants who didnot see the model perform.Table 6 reveals other interesting results. One alternative accountfor why people find algorithms so distasteful may rest on people’sdesire for perfect predictions. Specifically, people may choosehuman over algorithmic forecasts because, although they expectalgorithms to outperform humans on average, they expect a humanforecast to have a greater chance of being perfect. However, thedata in Table 6 fail to support this. In every condition—even thosein which people were unlikely to choose the model—participantsTable 5Estimates of Model’s and Human’s Performance: Means (and Standard Deviations)Control Human Model Model-and-humanEstimated % of model’s estimates within 5 percentilesStudy 1 46.52a(22.48)47.63a(23.48)28.24b(18.78)36.73b(22.61)Study 4 52.89a(17.50)50.64ab(20.28)37.51c(19.88)43.47b(20.83)Estimated % of human’s estimates within 5 percentilesStudy 1 37.02a(19.35)27.19b(18.84)32.67ab(21.25)31.63ab(19.90)Study 4 45.22a(18.76)36.80b(19.62)40.63ab(21.22)40.12ab(18.70)Estimated average absolute deviation of model’s estimatesStudy 3a 7.51a(8.19)5.08b(5.75)6.18ab(6.06)6.13ab(6.30)Study 3b 5.09b(6.84)4.87b(4.29)5.75ab(4.39)6.53a(5.43)Estimated average absolute deviation of human’s estimatesStudy 3a 8.56a(8.51)7.44a(7.51)7.36a(8.46)7.39a(6.87)Study 3b 8.11a(8.38)8.73a(7.40)7.29a(6.36)8.28a(6.71)Note.

believed the algorithm to be more likely than the human to yield aperfect prediction. Moreover, in Study 3b, the effect of seeing themodel err on the likelihood of betting on the model persisted evenamong those who thought the model was more perfect than them-selves (63% vs. 55%),/H92732(1,N/H11005795)/H110054.92,p/H11005.027. Thus, thealgorithm aversion that arises from experience with the modelseems not entirely driven by a belief that the model is less likelyto be perfect. Rather, it seems driven more by people being morelikely to learn that the model is bad when they see the model make(smaller) mistakes than they are to learn that the human is badwhen they see the human make (larger) mistakes.Finally, it is also interesting to consider the responses of par-ticipants in the control condition in Study 3b, who did not seeeither the model or themselves make forecasts before making theirjudgments. These participants expected a superhuman perfor-mance from the human—to perfectly predict 16.7 of 50 (33%)ranks—and a supermodel12performance from the model—to per-fectly predict 30.4 of 50 (61%) ranks. In reality, the humans andthe model perfectly predicted 2.2 (4%) and 6.0 (12%) ranks,respectively. Although one may forgive this optimism in light ofthe control condition’s unfamiliarity with the task, those withexperience, including those who saw both the model and thehuman perform, also expressed dramatically unrealistic expecta-tions, predicting the model and human to perfectly forecast manymore ranks than was possible (see Table 6). Even those withexperience may expect forecasters to perform at an impossiblyhigh level.Comparing the Model and Humanon Specific AttributesFor purely exploratory purposes, we asked participants in Stud-ies 2–4 to rate how the human and the model compared at differentaspects of forecasting. These scale items were inspired by obser-vations made by Dawes (1979), Einhorn (1986), and Grove andMeehl (1996), who articulated the various ways in which humansand algorithms may be perceived to differ. Our aim was to measurethese perceived differences, in the hope of understanding whatadvantages people believe humans to have over models (and viceversa), which could inform future attempts to reduce algorithmaversion.Table 7 shows the results of these measures. Participants right-fully thought that the model was better than human forecasters atavoiding obvious mistakes, appropriately weighing various attri-butes, and consistently weighing information. Consistent with re-search on the adoption of decision aids (see Highhouse, 2008),participants thought that the human forecasters were better than themodel at getting better with practice, learning from mistakes, andfinding underappreciated candidates. These data suggest that onemay attempt to reduce algorithm aversion by either educatingpeople of the importance of providing consistent and appropriateweights, or by convincing them that models can learn or thathumans cannot. We look forward to future research that builds onthese preliminary findings.General DiscussionThe results of five studies show that seeing algorithms err makespeople less confident in them and less likely to choose them overan inferior human forecaster. This effect was evident in twodistinct domains of judgment, including one in which the humanforecasters produced nearly twice as much error as the algorithm.It arose regardless of whether the participant was choosing be-tween the algorithm and her own forecasts or between the algo-rithm and the forecasts of a different participant. And it even aroseamong the (vast majority of) participants who saw the algorithmoutperform the human forecaster.The aversion to algorithms is costly, not only for the partic-ipants in our studies who lost money when they chose not to tietheir bonuses to the algorithm, but for society at large. Manydecisions require a forecast, and algorithms are almost alwaysbetter forecasters than humans (Dawes, 1979; Grove et al.,2000; Meehl, 1954).

of the “Big Data” movement (Davenport & Harris, 2007) haveencouraged the growth of algorithms but many remain resistantto using them. Our studies show that this resistance at leastpartially arises from greater intolerance for error from algo-rithms than from humans. People are more likely to abandon analgorithm than a human judge for making the same mistake.This is enormously problematic, as it is a barrier to adoptingsuperior approaches to a wide range of important tasks. Itmeans, for example, that people will more likely forgive anadmissions committee than an admissions algorithm for makingan error, even when, on average, the algorithm makes fewersuch errors. In short, whenever prediction errors are likely—asthey are in virtually all forecasting tasks—people will be biasedagainst algorithms.More optimistically, our findings do suggest that people will bemuch more willing to use algorithms when they do not see algo-rithms err, as will be the case when errors are unseen, the algo-rithm is unseen (as it often is for patients in doctors’ offices), orwhen predictions are nearly perfect. The 2012 U.S. presidentialelection season saw people embracing a perfectly performingalgorithm. Nate Silver’sNew York Timesblog, Five Thirty Eight:Nate Silver’s Political Calculus, presented an algorithm for fore-casting that election. Though the site had its critics before the voteswere in—oneWashington Postwriter criticized Silver for “doinglittle more than weighting and aggregating state polls and com-bining them with various historical assumptions to project a futureoutcome with exaggerated, attention-grabbing exactitude” (Ger-son, 2012, para. 2)—those critics were soon silenced: Silver’smodel correctly predicted the presidential election results in all 50states. Live on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow proclaimed, “You knowwho won the election tonight? Nate Silver,” (Noveck, 2012, para.21), and headlines like “Nate Silver Gets a Big Boost From theElection” (Isidore, 2012) and “How Nate Silver Won the 2012Presidential Election” (Clark, 2012) followed. Many journalistsand popular bloggers declared Silver’s success a great boost forBig Data and statistical prediction (Honan, 2012; McDermott,2012; Taylor, 2012; Tiku, 2012).However, we worry that this is not such a generalizable victory.People may rally around an algorithm touted as perfect, but wedoubt that this enthusiasm will generalize to algorithms that areshown to be less perfect, as they inevitably will be much of thetime.Limitations and Future DirectionsOur studies leave some open questions. First, we did not exploreall of the boundaries of our effect. For example, we found thatparticipants were significantly more likely to use humans thatproduced 13–97% more error than algorithms after seeing thosealgorithms err. However, we do not know if this effect wouldpersist if the algorithms in question were many times more accu-rate than the human forecasters. Presumably, there is some level ofperformance advantage that algorithms could exhibit over humansthat would lead forecasters to use the algorithms even after seeingthem err. However, in practice, algorithms’ advantage over humanforecasters is rarely larger than the advantage they had in ourstudies (Grove et al., 2000), and so the question of whether oureffects generalize to algorithms that have an even larger advantagemay not be an urgent one to answer. Also, although we found thiseffect on two distinct forecasting tasks, it is possible that our effectis contingent on features that these tasks had in common.Second, our studies did not explore the many ways in whichalgorithms may vary, and how those variations may affect algo-rithm aversion. For example, algorithms can differ in their com-plexity, the degree to which they are transparent to forecasters, thedegree to which forecasters are involved in their construction, andthe algorithm designer’s expertise, all of which may affect fore-casters’ likelihood of using an algorithm. For example, it is likelythat forecasters would be more willing to use algorithms built byexperts than algorithms built by amateurs. Additionally, peoplemay be more or less likely to use algorithms that are simple andtransparent—more likely if they feel more comfortable with trans-parent algorithms, but less likely if that transparency makes itobvious that the algorithm will err. We look forward to futureresearch investigating how algorithms’ attributes affect algorithmaversion.Third, our results show that algorithm aversion is not entirelydriven by seeing algorithms err. In the studies presented in thispaper, nontrivial percentages of participants continued to use analgorithm after they had seen it err and failed to use an algorithmTable 7Participants’ Perceptions of the Model Versus Human Forecaster on Specific Attributes: Means (and Standard Deviations)Study 2 Study 3a Study 3b Study 4Detecting exceptions 3.55h(0.99)3.02 (1.08) 2.98 (1.08) 3.91h(0.97)Finding underappreciated candidates 3.74h(0.96)4.04h(0.98)Avoiding obvious mistakes 2.68m(1.10)2.64m(1.03)2.62m(1.02)2.55m(1.13)Learning from mistakes 3.91h(0.81)3.74h(0.92)3.67h(0.95)3.81h(0.99)Appropriately weighing a candidate’squalities (state’s attributes) 2.98 (1.09) 2.50m(0.92)2.34m(0.93)2.81m(1.11)Consistently weighing information 2.33m(1.10)2.49m(1.00)2.29m(0.98)2.05m(1.02)Treating each student (state) individually 3.60h(1.02)2.94 (1.02) 2.89m(1.02)3.48h(1.25)Getting better with practice 3.85h(0.82)3.66h(0.96)3.63h(0.98)3.77h(1.08)Note. In Studies 2–3b, participants were asked to “Please indicate how you and the model compare on the following attributes.” In Study 4, participantswere asked to “Please indicate how the lab participant and the model compare on the following attributes.” All answers were given on 5-point scales, from1(Model is much better) to 5 (I am [The participant is] much better). Each mean significantly below the scale midpoint is denoted with an “m” subscript,indicating that the model is significantly better than the human; each mean significantly above the scale midpoint is denoted with an “h” subscript, indicatingthat the human is significantly better than the model.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.11ALGORITHM AVERSION

when they had not seen it err. This suggests that there are otherimportant drivers of algorithm aversion that we have not uncov-ered. Finally, our research has little to say about how best to reducealgorithm aversion among those who have seen the algorithm err.This is the next (and great) challenge for future research.ReferencesArkes, H.
