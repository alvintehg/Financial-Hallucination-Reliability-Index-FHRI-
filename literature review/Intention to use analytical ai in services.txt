Abstract
Purpose –The automation of services is rapidly gro wing, led by sectors such as banking and
financial investment. The growing number of investments managed by artificial intelligence (AI)
suggests that this technology-ba sed service will become increasingl y popular. This study examines
how customers ’technology readiness a nd service awareness affect thei r intention to use analytical AI
investment services.
Design/methodology/approach –Hypotheses were tested with a data set of 404 North American-based
potential customers of robo-advisors. In addition to technology readiness dimensions, the potential customers ’
characteristics were included in the framework as moderating factors (age, gender and previous experience
with financial investment services). A post-hoc analysis examined the roles of service awareness and the
financial advisor ’s name (i.e., robo-advisor vs. AI-advisor).
Findings –The results indicated that customers ’technological optimism increases, and insecurity decreases,
their intention to use robo-advisors. Surprisingly, feelings of technological discomfort positively influencedrobo-advisor adoption. This interesting finding challenges previous insights into technology adoption and
value co-creation as analytical AI puts customers into a very passive role and reduces barriers to technology
adoption. The research also analyzes how consumers become aware of robo-advisors, and how this influences
their acceptance.
Originality/value –This is the first study to analyze the role of customers ’technology readiness in the
adoption of analytical AI. The authors link the findings to previous technology adoption and automatedservices ’literature and provide specific managerial implications and avenues for further research.

1. Introduction
Technological advances in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are radically changing
service provision ( Belanche et al., 2020a ;Luet al., 2020 ;Robinson et al., 2020 ).Huang and Rust
(2018) predicted that automated technology will gradually replace workers in task requiring
mechanical, analytical, intuitive and even empathetic intelligence. Wirtz et al. (2018) proposed
that AI software that works autonomously and learns over time can be distinguished from
service robots depending on manifestation (virtual or physical), level of anthropomorphism
(from none to high) and task orientation. For companies, AI data and knowledge are likely to
become important sources of competitive advantage, based on economies of scale and scope,
leading to “winners-take-all ”markets ( Wirtz et al., 2018 ).
The banking and finance industries has become prototypical examples of the AI
technological revolution worldwide as a sector leading internal and customer-oriented
automation processes ( Caron, 2019 ). In this regard, financial technology (FinTech) has
revolutionized the finance industry by increasing user value and firms ’revenues in the last
decade ( Huang and Rust, 2021 ;Kumar et al., 2019 ;Goldstein et al., 2019 ).
Within the scope of AI-based financial services, this study focuses on robo-advisor agents,
that is, agents which automate or assist in managing investments by replacing human
advisory services and/or the customer ’s own management, a recent innovation in the finance
industry ( Goldstein et al., 2019 ). The assets under robo-advisor management are expected to
grow annually by 27.0%, reaching US$ 2,552bn in 2023, while the number of robo-advisor
users is expected to grow by 75.4% year-on-year until 2023 ( Statista, 2019 ). As distinct from
most mechanical-based automation (e.g. robots), these innovative services are based on
analytical AI, which has been defined as the ability to process, and learn from, information for
problem-solving purposes ( Huang and Rust, 2018 ). Nonetheless, the penetration rate of robo-
advisors among customers is still relatively low ( Jung et al., 2018b ;Belanche et al., 2020a ). To
address this challenge, there is a need to better understand how to integrate AI into service
offerings. To this end, several experts in the AI adoption domain (e.g. Mende et al., 2019 ;van
Doorn et al., 2017 ;Belanche et al., 2020a ) have suggested that the technology readiness index
(TRI) is a suitable framework, hitherto unexplored, in this novel context.
To address this research gap, we apply the TRI to examine the role of technology readiness in
explaining intention to use robo-advisors, prototypical examples of analytical AI services already
accessible to a wide spectrum of customers. Unlike technology acceptance models based oncustomer motivations, the TRI ( Parasuraman, 2000 ) captures consumers ’positive (i.e. optimism
and innovativeness) and negative (i.e. discomfort and insecurity) mental readiness regarding
technologies. The TRI dimensions assess crucial consumer perceptions in the financial sector,
such as their enthusiasm (optimism), perceived control (or discomfort) and service reliability (or
insecurity); these often determine the initial investment decisions that can lead to successful long-
term relational exchanges ( Clark-Murphy and Soutar, 2004 ). The framework also categorizes
users based on their propensity to embrace technologies as it links personality and technology
use (Walczuch et al., 2007 ) and facilitates the design of segmentation variables ( Victorino et al.,
2009). Therefore, as robo-advisors represent a di sruptive technological advance, the TRI seems
particularly suited to understanding customer willingness to use AI-based services.
As a complement to this framework, we propose that customers with higher awareness of
robo-advisors may be more willing to use these innovative services. Service awareness, an
important variable in other service domains (e.g. Andersen et al.,2 0 0 0 ;Crist et al.,2 0 0 7 ), has
been neglected in previous research based on the assumption that customers are fully aware of
the available technologies ( Venkatesh et al. , 2003 ); however, these assumptions may be
misplaced as these innovations are just starting to penetrate the market. In addition, to increase
the practical implications of our research, we propose that renaming “robo-advisors ”as
“AI-advisors ”, a more accurate and sophisticated description, unrelated to robots, may increase
their acceptance by potential adopters. Finally, previous studies have found that individualJOSM

characteristics are key in explaining technology usage and proposed them as moderating
variables ( Sun and Zhang, 2006 ;Blut and Wang, 2019 ). Therefore, we include age, gender and
previous investment experience in the model as moderating variables ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ).
The present study ’s contribution is threefold. First, we empirically investigate the
adoption of a prototypical analytical AI service, financial robo-advisors. Most of the previous
research into automation has been conceptual in nature, and the growing number of empirical
studies in the field focus on mechanical-AI (e.g. service robots). However, analytical AI
represents a more advanced stage in the development of intelligent automation skills ( Huang
and Rust, 2018 ), with distinctive features that make it ideal for service personalization and
optimal productivity (e.g. it learns from, and adapts to, data, Belanche et al., 2020b ;Huang and
Rust, 2021 ). Due to the disruptive nature of analytical AI and its multiple social and economic
implications, there is an urgent need for more research and analysis in this fast-growing area.
Second, by drawing on the TRI framework, we assess to what extent regular customers are
ready to embrace an autonomous technology that pe rforms analytical tasks traditionally carried
out by humans (i.e. investing customers ’money). This is the first study to apply the TRI
framework to identify if analytical AI adoption di ffers from the adoption of previous technological
innovations, research which has been repeate d l yc a l l e df o rb ys c h o l a r si nt h ef i e l d( e . g . Mende
et al., 2019 ;van Doorn et al.,2 0 1 7 ;Belanche et al., 2020a ). In contrast to the previous new
technology adoption literature, our study reveal ed that technological discomfort does not harm,
instead it promotes, the adoption of robo-advisors. That is, customers who feel overwhelmed by
technology are more likely to use analytical AI as it is a simple system that requires minimal user
participation. This important finding suggests, in the case of analytical AI, there is a need to
reconsider previous theoretical technology adoption and value co-creation axioms as users may
not, in the future, play such active roles in value creation and decision-making.
Third, our research identified consumer awareness as a critical, but frequently ignored,
factor in adoption; thus, to identify how consumers become aware of robo-advisors, a post-
hoc analysis was conducted. In summary, this research advances the understanding of
customers ’decisions about the use of analytical AI services and can help managers design
better strategies for the successful introduction of these innovations.
The remainder of this work is structured as follows. First, we review the previous robo-
advisor literature. Second, we develop the research model ’s hypotheses to explain customers ’
intention to use analytical AI services. Third, we describe the data collection procedure and
the measurement validation. Next, we present the results of the empirical and the post-hocanalyses. Finally, we discuss the main conclusions, the theoretical and practical implications,
the study ’s limitations and further research lines.
2. Literature review
AI has been defined as “machines exhibiting facets of human intelligence ”(Huang and Rust,
2018, p. 155). Previous research in the service domain has posited that customers approach
AI-related services differently to how they approach traditional services ( Grewal et al., 2017 ).
Unlike other technologies (e.g . self-service technologies), AI-based systems operate
autonomously or with few instructions, often replacing humans ( Belanche et al., 2020b ;De
Keyser et al.
, 2019 ). Thus, companies must understand how to introduce AI technologies to
reduce barriers to their use by customers ( Mazurek and Ma łagocka, 2019 ) to improve
management practices and product offerings ( Kumar et al., 2019 ).
2.1 Previous robo-advisor knowledge
Robo-advisors have been defined as “digital platforms comprising interactive and intelligent
user assistance components that use information technology to guide customers through an
automated investment advisory process ”(Jung et al., 2018a , p. 81). Financial robo-advisors
are based on narrow analytical AI that technically exceeds human abilities (memory, fasterIntention to use

295

=== Page 4 ===
information processing, etc.) ( Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019 ). Robo-advisors provide financial
advice with minimal human intervention. From the customer perspective, investing via robo-
advisors is simple and practical; they need only around 10 min to register and start investing
(Belanche et al., 2019 ). The clients first complete a short online form that evaluates their risk
tolerance and return expectations. The AI system then creates a personal investment
portfolio and offers recommendations and/or makes automated adjustments based on the
consumer ’s risk profile and objectives. The service is, thus, a prototypical example of an
analytical AI-based technology, widely available to the public.
The previous literature has indicated that the two main advantages of AI-based financial
services are profitability and cost savings ( Trecet, 2019 ). In addition, important factors such
as transparency and temporal and ubiquitous accessibility to financial services are
fundamental pillars of the diffusion of robo-advisors ( Belanche et al., 2019 ;Jung et al., 2018b ).
Robo-advisors have been described also as instruments that will democratize the investing
world by reducing entry barriers to financial advisory services for a wider public ( Dayan,
2019); nevertheless, it has not yet been established whether regular customers are ready to
embrace these technologies.
From the managerial perspective, the scant literature on robo-advisors has focused on
legal issues ( Jung et al., 2019 ). These authors suggested that critical robo-advisor weaknesses
are lack of personal contact, and the risk is that they will not fulfill regulatory fiduciary
requirements. Ji (2017) proposed that companies should be more transparent about the
decisions made by asset-allocation algorithms by, for example, revealing how they deal with
conflicting interests and risk management. Furthermore, Tertilt and Scholz (2018)
highlighted differences in the quality of investment advice offered, positing that robo-
advisors usually ask relatively few questions during risk evaluations.
From a customer-oriented approach, Faloon and Scherer (2017) highlighted the value
provided by system personalization. Similarly, Glaser et al. (2019) examined how the design of
service interfaces might affect financial risk taking, particularly in the context of the need to
present information differently to individuals making large investments. Focusing on
technology adoption models, Belanche et al. (2019) found that perceived usefulness, ease of
use and subjective norms (i.e. social influences) affected robo-advisor acceptance. Ben-David
and Sade (2018) found that performance expectancy and distrust (anxiety) determined
preferences for robo-advisors over human advisors.
However, despite the increasing interest in, and expected growth of, robo-advisors, some
authors have argued that customers are less enthusiastic about robo-advisors than about
banks ( Jung et al. , 2018b ), which may be because customers are not yet ready to rely on
AI-driven systems ( Belanche et al., 2020a ).van Doorn et al. (2017) andMende et al. (2019) ,
focusing on the rise of automated agents, proposed segmenting consumers based on broad
measures such as technology readiness ( Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 ).
3. Hypotheses formulation
3.1 Technology readiness
Personality differences are regarded in management and marketing theories as important
human behavior determinants. Prior new technology acceptance literature has argued that
individual ’s reactions to technology are diverse ( Mick and Fournier, 1998 ;Ratchford, 2020 ).
This can be explained by the positive and negative feelings technology triggers in customers
(Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 ). In this regard, Parasuraman (2000) developed the TRI,
defining technology readiness as “people ’s propensity to embrace and use new technologies
for accomplishing goals in home life and at work ”(p. 308). The TRI captures consumers ’
positive and negative mental readiness regarding technology; it has previously been
employed to explain the adoption of innovations such self-service technology in airports
(Liljander et al., 2006 ), C2C platforms ( Luet al., 2012 ) and mobile payment systems ( MartensJOSM
33,2
296

=== Page 5 ===
et al., 2017 ). Technology readiness (later improved and renamed TRI 2.0 ( Parasuraman and
Colby, 2015 )) is measured through four dimensions: two motivators, optimism and
innovativeness, and two inhibitors, discomfort and insecurity. Prior research has
underlined the independence of the four dimensions as each measures the extent of a
person ’s openness to technology differently ( Luet al., 2012 ).
Technological optimism represents “a positive view of technology and a belief that it
offers people increased control, flexibility, and efficiency in their lives ”(Parasuraman and
Colby, 2015 , p. 60). This definition can be extended to AI as people may perceive it as a “hell”
or a“heaven ”(Kaplan and Haenlein, 2020 ). Optimists accept situations and are more willing
to use new technologies ( Luet al. , 2012 ), perceiving them as functional and trustworthy,
overlooking possible negatives outcomes, than are pessimistic technology users ( Walczuch
et al. , 2007 ). Thus, optimistic customers are more positively predisposed toward new
technologies ( Godoe and Johansen, 2012 ). In the financial sector, more enthusiastic consumers
tend to look for new investment opportunities ( Clark-Murphy and Soutar, 2004 ), for example,
robo-advisors. Thus, we propose that:
H1. Customers ’technological optimism has a positive effect on their intention to use
financial robo-advisors.
Technological innovativeness has been defined as “a tendency to be a technology pioneer and
thought leader ”(Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 , p. 60). Innovators are willing to try new
technologies ( Martens et al., 2017 ) and related services ( Rodriguez-Ricardo et al., 2018 ). Highly
innovative people tend to be open-minded and exhibit greater willingness to use technologies,
including innovative financial services, for example, mobile payment ( Oliveira et al., 2016 ).
Furthermore, innovativeness is an antecedent of adoption intentions; innovative customers
generally have a positive impression of technology functionality even when its potential
value is uncertain ( Prodanova et al., 2021 ). Thus, we propose:
H2. Customers ’technological innovativeness has a positive effect on their intention to
use financial robo-advisors.
Technology discomfort has been defined as “a perceived lack of control over technology and a
feeling of being overwhelmed by it ”(Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 , p. 60). People who
experience discomfort with technologies perceive them as complicated and unable to satisfy
their needs ( Luet al., 2012 ). Customers experiencing high levels of discomfort in an unknown
technology environment can feel averse toward using new technology-based products and
services ( Tsang et al. , 2004 ). The feeling of lacking control or the capability to deal with
technologies can result in rejection of innovative systems. Customers who feel discomfort in
surrendering control to an automated system may not want to use robo-advisor services.
Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H3. Customers ’technological discomfort has a negative effect on their intention to use
financial robo-advisors.
Finally, technology insecurity has been defined as “distrust of technology, stemming from
skepticism about its ability to work properly and concerns about its potential harmful
consequences ”(Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 , p. 60). Users need at least a rudimentary
understanding of how AI systems function to have confidence in them ( Kaplan and Haenlein,
2019). Customers with high levels of technology insecurity may avoid using them ( Luet al.,
2012). Prior studies have concluded that, in the finance industry, insecure customers tend to
refuse to adopt new technology-based services ( Oliveira et al., 2016 ). Thus, we posit:
H4. Customers ’technological insecurity has a negative effect on their intention to use
financial robo-advisors.Intention to use

3.2 Awareness
Service awareness has been defined as “being conscious of, having knowledge of, or being
informed about a given service ”(Crist et al., 2007 , p. 212). Awareness has not hitherto been
closely examined in the technology acceptance literature, but it may be particularly important
in the study of recently launched technological services such as robo-advisors. In advertising,
awareness refers to product/brand recognition ( Hellofs and Jacobson, 1999 ) and indicates that
customers have paid attention to, and are conscious of, information provided about a new
product or service.
The scarce literature on service awareness focuses on specific domains. In the elderly care
sector, most studies understand awareness as the customers ’knowledge about the existence
of the service ( Andersen et al., 2000 ). In this sense, individuals with more knowledge about
elderly care services are more aware of their options and use them to a greater extent than
those hearing about the services for the first time ( Crist et al. , 2007 ). Thus, individuals ’
awareness of services is related to the information they have received, researched and their
experiences. Previous research in an organizational context has shown that when employees
are aware of their company ’s corporate social responsibility activities, this encourages them
to contribute to the company ’s efforts ( Raub and Blunschi, 2014 ). Applying this concept to
this research domain, we propose that customers who are aware of robo-advisors will be more
willing to use them. Accordingly, we propose:
H5. Customers ’awareness has a positive effect on their intention to use financial robo-
advisors.
3.3 Moderating effects
Previous research has suggested that individual characteristics may help explain the
dynamics of technology acceptance ( Sun and Zhang, 2006 ). More specifically, age, gender and
the user ’s previous experience have been proposed as key moderating factors ( Venkatesh
et al., 2003 ;Sun and Zhang, 2006 ).
It has been found that technology adoption decisions made by younger/older users may be
based on different factors (e.g. Venkatesh et al., 2003 ;Wang et al., 2009 ;Chawla and Joshi,
2020). For example, younger users place more importance on extrinsic rewards, that is,
positive outcomes ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ), which are linked to technological optimism; thus,
optimism will be a more important determinant of intention to use robo-advisors for younger
than for older users. Similarly, younger consumers easily become familiar with new
technologies ( Hauk et al., 2018 ). They have grown up in a digital world with easy access to
copious information ( Brenner, 2020 ), and thus, they are accustomed and may attach more
value, to being up to date. Therefore, optimism and innovativeness may be more important
for younger than for older users in the adoption of financial robo-advisors. In contrast, while
younger customers feel competent to use digital innovations ( Hauk et al. , 2018 ), older
customers are typically less skilled in using technological devices and services ( Dietrich,
2016). Using new technologies requires fluid cognitive abilities, which decrease with age
(Salthouse, 2004 ). Therefore, technological discomfort and insecurity may be more important
barriers for older customers. Finally, as the mental ability to process information decreases
with age ( Cole and Balasubramanian, 1993 ), older users may limit the amount of information
they use in their decision-making and mainly rely on their own, previously held beliefs
(Belanche et al., 2012 ). Thus, awareness may be more important for older consumers as it
involves being conscious of, and having information about, the new technology, which may
help them form more stable and concrete beliefs about the technology. Based on these points,
the following hypothesis is proposed:
H6. Optimism (H6a) and innovativeness (H6b) influence consumers ’intention to use
financial robo-advisors more for younger than for older customers; in turn,JOSM
33,2
298

=== Page 7 ===
discomfort (H6c), insecurity (H6d) and awareness (H6e) influence intention to use
financial robo-advisors more for older than for younger customers.
Another important moderating factor in the ado ption and use of emergent technologies is gender
(e.g.Sun and Zhang, 2006 ;Faqih, 2016 ;Wang et al., 2009 ;Chawla and Joshi, 2020 ). This may be
due to the differences between men ’s and women ’s decision-making processes ( Venkatesh and
Morris, 2000 ) as they consider different factors as more important when evaluating behaviors.
The consumer behavior literature has identified that men are more motivated by achievement
needs than women ( Hoffman, 1972 ); therefore, with identical levels of technological optimism,
men may be more likely to adopt new technologies to achieve gains. Similarly, previous studies
have suggested that, traditionally, men are mor e associated with innovative behaviors than are
women ( Luksyte et al. , 2018 ); thus, following role congruity ( Eagly and Karau, 2002 ),
innovativeness may be a more important factor for men than for women. On the other hand,
women tend to exhibit higher anxiety and lower self-efficacy than men when dealing with new
technologies ( Sun and Zhang, 2006 ;He and Freeman, 2019 ), to the extent that they avoid
technologies that cause them discomfort ( Faqih, 2016 ). As a result, with identical levels of
discomfort and insecurity, women may be less likely than men to adopt new technologies.
Similarly, women may value awareness more than men do because it reduces their anxiety levelsand increases their perceived self-efficacy. Indeed, as a means of increasing their confidence with
a technology, women tend to acquire relevant knowledge, by consulting additional information
sources, before making decisions ( Burke, 2001 ), which suggests that awareness may be more
important for women than for men ( Sorce et al.,2 0 0 5 ). Accordingly, we propose:
H7. Optimism (H7a) and innovativeness (H7b) influence consumer intention to use
financial robo-advisors more for men than for women; discomfort (H7c), insecurity
(H7d) and awareness (H7e) influence intention to use financial robo-advisors more for
men than for women.
Finally, previous studies have suggested that experienced and inexperienced users form their
intentions in different ways ( Sun and Zhang, 2006 ;Venkatesh et al.,2 0 0 3 ). The individual ’sp r i o r
experience with financial services may form his/her behavioral intentions, based on his/her
habits and favorable predisposition toward investment services ( Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975 ).
Consequently, previous experience is another moderator variable that has been extensively
examined in technology acceptance studies ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ;Venkatesh, 2000 ). Experience
also increases customers ’perceptions of their ability and confidence to manage new information
services ( Meuter et al., 2005 ). Conversely, feelings of insecurity or discomfort may be more
important for new than for repeat customers ( Constantinides, 2004 ). Thus, all other things being
equal, where the consumer has more investment experience, this will enhance the positive effects
of technological optimism and innovativeness, an d reduce the negative effects of technological
discomfort and insecurity, In turn, service awareness may be more important for less
experienced customers than for more experienced customers as the previous literature suggests
that less experienced customers need more information about new products and services toadopt them ( Breuer and Brettel, 2012 ). Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H8. Optimism (H8a) and innovativeness (H8b) influence intention to use financial robo-
advisors more for experienced than they do for less experienced customers; in turn,
discomfort (H8c), insecurity (H8d) and awareness (H8e) influence intention to use
financial robo-advisors more for less experienced than they do for more experienced
customers.
3.4 Control variables
3.4.1 Technology acceptance model (TAM). The technology acceptance model (TAM) ( Davis,
1989;Davis et al. , 1989 ), due to its parsimony and predictive capability, has been widelyIntention to use
analytical AI
299

=== Page 8 ===
employed to explain technology adoption in various sectors ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ). Thus, to
complete our framework, we introduce perceptions of ease of use and usefulness (the TAM ’s
two independent variables) as control variables that may exert a positive effect on behavioral
intentions toward robo-advisors. Davis defined ease of use as “the degree to which a person
believes that using a particular system would be free of effort ”, and perceived usefulness as
“the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or
her performance ”(Davis, 1989 , p. 320).
3.4.2 Sociodemographics. Sociodemographic factors have been shown to be important in
the adoption of technology and financial services; they may also exert a direct effect on
behavioral intentions ( Xiao and Kumar, 2019 ). In other words, robo-advisors may be more
accepted by some customers groups than by others ( Belanche et al., 2020a ). Thus, for the sake
of completeness, the direct effects of age, gender and previous investment experience on
intention to use robo-advisors are included in the model.
3.4.3 FinTech name. Finally, to increase the contribution of this research and enhance its
managerial implications for this first stage of the adoption process, we manipulated the name
given to this new automated financial advisory service. Currently, the term “robo-advisor ”
(i.e. the contracted form of robotic-advisor) is the academic and industry standard ( Jung et al.,
2018a ;McCann, 2020 ). However, it includes the word “robot ”; robots have been defined as
“mechanical devices programed to perform specific physical tasks ”(Belanche et al., 2020a ,
p. 205). Thus, the term robo-advisor may mistakenly suggest that this service is provided by a
physical machine or humanoid agent. It is proposed that the term “AI-advisor ”is much more
appropriate because the tasks are performed through AI, that is, “technologies that mimic or
even surpass human intelligence ”(Huang et al., 2019 , p. 44), not by robots. Indeed, analytical
AI learns from, and adapts to, data input, which represents a higher level of advancement
than mechanical technologies ( Huang and Rust, 2018 ;Belanche et al. , 2020b ). Therefore,
despite the increasing popularity of the name “robo-advisor ”, we propose that the more
accurate and sophisticated term, “AI-advisor ”, may directly increase consumers ’intention to
use the system. Nevertheless, this influence may be particularly important for some
customers (e.g. those more reluctant to use the technology). Indeed, previous research found
that preference for service and brand names often depends on other factors such as consumer
sociodemographics (e.g. Klink, 2009 ), which suggests possible moderation effects on this
control variable that we include in our model for the sake of completeness.
Figure 1 summarizes the proposed research framework.
4. Method
4.1 Data collection
The study data were collected through an online survey designed and hosted by
SurveyMonkey. An invitation and link to the questionnaire was sent to US-based English-
speaking consumers between 20 and 85 years. This sampling process was conducted using a
reputable consumer panel comprising over 70,000 consumers unrelated to any specific
banking provider. The participants were paid US$ 1.20. Only those respondents who
completed the whole questionnaire in a reasonable timeframe were rewarded/considered for
analysis. After removing 14 records due to incomplete responses, the final sample was 404.
The sample was very similar in sociodemographic terms to North American consumers aged
between 20 and 85 ( US Census Bureau Office, 2020 ).Table 1 shows the participants ’and US
population ’s demographics.
The invitation link asked the panelists to participate in a study about financial services.
Replicating other experimental design manipulation procedures, for around half of the sample
the advisor was referred to as a “robo-advisor ”; whereas for the other half, it was referred to as
an“AI-advisor ”. Some 207 participants were randomly assigned to the AI-advisor scenario, andJOSM

197 to the robo-advisor scenario. The name given to the service was the only difference between
the scenarios. Both subgroups were similar in terms of gender and age distribution. Specifically,
χ2tests confirms that there is no significant difference in gender ( χ250.329, 1 d.f., p>0 . 1 )a n d
age (χ2510.105, 12 d.f., p> 0.1) distributions between both groups. The questionnaires were
adapted to the different financial service names. The study ’s website gave the participants the
kind of information normally presented to consumers considering using robo-advisors. First,
they were provided with a basic general description of financial robo-advisors (or AI-advisor);
this explained that they were new autonomous financial advisors that evaluated the market
through analytical AI and adapted their advice to the customers ’profiles. As robo-advisors
have no anthropomorphic appearance, the description included four illustrative screenshots of
a real financial advisor interface, showing graphs and rates adapted to avoid brand familiarity
bias (i.e. colors, fonts and figures were altered, and company names omitted). The questionnaire
included TRI-related scales of optimism, innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity; it alsoasked the respondents about their level of awareness of these financial services. They were also
asked to indicate the perceived ease of use and usefulness of, and their intention to use, robo-
advisors/AI-advisors. The final questions covered sociodemographics (age and gender) and
previous investment experience.
4.2 Measurement instrument
All scales used in the study were adapted from the previous literature. Appendix shows the
scale items employed for the robo-advisors (as aforementioned, the scales were also adapted
to the “AI-advisor ”name). Specifically, we incorporated Parasuraman and Colby ’s (2015) TRI;
this uses 16 items (four per construct) to measure customers ’levels of optimism,
innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity ( Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 ). The consumers ’
awareness of robo-advisor services was measured using a three-item scale adapted from
Raub and Blunschi (2014) andCollins (2007) . Following previous research, awareness was
measured using the following question: “How did you know about robo-advisors? ”(Kangis
and Passa, 1997 ). Perceptions of ease of use and usefulness were measured using scalesTechnology Readiness

developed by Davis et al. (1989) and Bhattacherjee (2000) , four items per variable. The
participants ’intention to use robo-advisors was measured using three items adapted from
Bhattacherjee (2000) . All scales used self-reported measures based on seven-point Likert-type
response formats, from 1 ( “completely disagree ”)t o7( “completely agree ”). The demographic
questions covered age (1 520–24 years, 2 525–29, 3530–34, 4535–39, 5540–44, 6545–49,

(15woman, 0 5man), and the participants were asked about previous investment experience
(15yes, 05no).

as the estimation method because the main goal of this research is predictive (i.e. to predict
intention to use robo-advisors). PLS is appropriate because, as a variance-based (VB) SEM
(compared to the covariance-based [CB] SEM), it provides optimal predictive power (e.g.
Fornell and Bookstein, 1982 ;Bagozzi, 1994 ). In addition, PLS modeling is particularly useful
for testing exploratory models formed by numerous variables under normality and non-
normality data distribution assumptions ( Hair et al., 2016 ;Rold /C19an and S /C19anchez-Franco, 2012 ).
Similarly, the previous literature (e.g. Anderson and Gerbing, 1988 ;Baumgartner and
Homburg, 1996 ) has suggested that, to identify a model in CB SEM, a minimum of three
indicators per construct must be used. Therefore, as we consider sociodemographics (age,
gender and previous investment experience) using only one indicator per construct and
develop a complex model which includes several simultaneous direct and moderating effects,
PLS is more appropriate ( Davcik, 2014 ). Finally, this analytical method has been frequently
used in well-established service journals ( Hogreve et al., 2019 ;Bacile, 2020 ).
To assess the validity of the measurement model, we first confirmed the constructs ’
convergent validity. All item loadings exceeded the recommended value of 0.7 ( Henseler et al.,
2009), except for the first insecurity item ( λ50.499), which was removed from the model. As
Table 2 shows, both the Cronbach ’sαand the composite reliability of the latent constructs
exceeded the 0.7 thresholds ( Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994 ). Furthermore, the average
variance extracted (AVE) of each construct exceeded the recommended threshold of 0.5 ( Hair
et al., 2013 ).
To test for discriminant validity (see Table 3 ), we verified that the square roots of the
AVEs for each construct were greater than the inter-construct correlations ( Fornell and
Larcker, 1981 ). Furthermore, the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT), which evaluates the
average of the HTMT correlations, was, in each case, below the 0.85 threshold ( Henseler
et al., 2015 ).
Finally, we tested for available global model fit measures using PLS-SEM. The normed fit
index (NFI) was 0.85, which is close to the recommended 0.90 ( Hu and Bentler, 1998 ). The
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) of the research model was 0.05, which is
lower than 0.08, indicating good model fit ( Hu and Bentler, 1998 ).
5. Results
5.1 Structural model
To test the hypotheses and the structural model, the SmartPLS algorithm, followed by
bootstrapping with 5,000 subsamples, was used ( Hair et al., 2011 ). The results are presented in
Table 4 . As to the technology readiness-related hypotheses, the results indicated that
customers ’optimism significantly influenced their intention to use robo-advisors ( β50.187,
p< 0.01), supporting Hypothesis 1 . In turn, customers ’level of innovativeness did not have a
significant effect on use intentions ( β5/C00.015, p> 0.10); thus, Hypothesis 2 is not supported.

Contrary to expectations, customers ’discomfort with technologies had a significant positive
influence on behavioral intentions ( β50.079, p< 0.10); thus, Hypothesis 3 , which proposed a
negative effect, is not supported. Conversely, customers ’feelings of insecurity with the
technology had a significant negative impact on their intentions to use robo-advisor financial
services ( β5/C00.094, p< 0.05), supporting Hypothesis 4 . In addition, the consumers ’
awareness of robo-advisors had a significant positive effect on their intention to use these

Most of the influences exerted by the control variables were consistent with the previous
literature. That is, customers ’perceptions of both robo-advisors ’ease of use ( β50.125,
p< 0.05) and usefulness ( β50.413, p< 0.01) had a significant positive impact on their
decisions to use them. Older customers showed lower intentions to use the service
(β5/C00.076, p< 0.05). Nevertheless, gender did not have a direct influence on intentions to
use robo-advisors ( β50.001, p> 0.10). Similarly, the customers ’previous investment
experience did not significantly influence their behavioral intentions ( β50.025, p> 0.10).
Finally, the FinTech name used (AI-advisor vs robo-advisor) did not have a direct influence
on use intentions ( β50.033, p> 0.10).
The results of the analysis of the moderating effects produced some interesting findings.
Age did not moderate the effect of the TRI variables on intention to use. Thus, optimism,
innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity affected customers similarly, irrespective of age.
However, age moderated the effect of awareness on intention to use ( β5/C00.083, p< 0.10);
being aware of robo-advisors was more important for younger than for older customers.
Awareness was also moderated by gender ( β50.090, p< 0.05), that is, being aware of robo-
advisors is more important for women than it is for men. Gender also moderated the effect of
innovativeness ( β5/C00.090, p< 0.05), that is, the influence of innovativeness on intention to
use robo-advisors was higher for men than for women. Nevertheless, gender did not moderate
the effect of the other two TRI variables. Conversely, investment experience moderated the
influence of insecurity on intention to use ( β5/C00.100, p< 0.05), that is, insecurity acts as an
inhibitor of adoption for less experienced customers. Nevertheless, investment experience did
not moderate the influence of optimism, innovativeness, discomfort and awareness on
behavioral intentions. Finally, the name given to the service, “AI-advisor ”or“robo-advisor ”,
did not influence use intentions or moderate the influence of the other independent variables.
These relationships help explain the dependent variable, behavioral intention to use robo-
advisors ( R250.566). This value can be considered to have a high level of explained variance
in comparison to previous studies examining behavioral intentions toward technology-based
services ( Venkatesh and Davis, 2000 ). As an additional assessment of the model ’s capability
to predict the endogenous variable, we examined the Stone –Geisser Q2using the blindfolding
technique ( Tenenhaus et al. , 2005 ). This indicator showed a value well above zero
(Q250.512), thus the observed values of intention to use can be reconstructed as evidence of
the model ’s predictive relevance ( Henseler et al., 2009 ).
5.2 Post-hoc analysis: the roles of awareness and financial advisor name
To better understand consumer awareness, we carried out a post-hoc analysis. As normal in
research into service awareness in other fields (e.g. Kangis and Passa, 1997 ), the questionnaire
asked the respondents if they had previously been aware of robo-advisor services. Some
54.95% of the sample reported that they had not been very aware of robo-advisors, and
45.05% that they had learned about robo-advisors through the following means: 32.11% from
press and news reports, 26.42% from financial services ads, 12.20% because their bank had
directly offered them the service, 11.38% through their own means (i.e. through online
searches and their own experiences), 8.94% from other customers and 8.94% through other
means (e.g. specialized investment magazines and blogs). We analyzed to what extent robo-
advisor adoption was affected by how consumers became aware of them. As the categories
were not exclusive, independent t-tests were conducted; taking one example, we compared
intention to use robo-advisors by the customer group who learned about them through
advertising with those who did not learn about them through advertising. The results
showed that awareness of robo-advisors by almost any means increased intention to use,
supporting Hypothesis 5 . The analyses showed that customers with higher intention to use
robo-advisors had learned about the services through their own means ( M54.64, t54.35,
p< 0.01), followed by customers who received information directly from their banksJOSM
33,2

=== Page 15 ===
(M54.40, t53.72, p< 0.01) and from other customers ( M54.30, t52.74, p< 0.01);
participants who had been exposed to robo-advisor advertisements ( M53.81, t52.51,
p<0.05) and related news items ( M53.78, t52.70, p< 0.01) also had increased intentions to
use the services, but to a lesser extent. Being aware of robo-advisors by other means did not
significantly influence use intention ( M53.55, t50.66, p> 0.10). Figure 2 illustrates use
intentions based on how customers became aware of the services.
In addition, we used the participants ’responses to test whether the financial advisor ’s
name had a differential effect on behavioral intentions among those aware and unaware of the
service. We performed a 2 (aware vs unaware) 32 (AI-advisor vs. robo-advisor) analysis of
variance (ANOVA) to assess the interaction effect between both factors on intention to use.
The results of the ANOVA confirmed that consumer awareness significantly increased
intention to use ( F525.82; p< 0.01), whereas the financial advisor ’s name did not ( F51.17;
p> 0.01). The interaction effect between both variables on intention to use was also
significant ( F525.82; p< 0.01), as Figure 3 shows. Specifically, the FinTech name did not
significantly affect customers unaware of the service ( MAI-advisor 52.78, MRobo-advisor 53.02,
t51.07, p> 0.10). However, the financial service ’s name was important for customers aware
of the service; they presented higher use intentions for AI-advisors than for robo-advisors
(MAI-advisor 54.08, MRobo-advisor 53.47, t52.37, p< 0.05).
6. Discussion
6.1 Theoretical implications
Robo-advisor services represent a prototypical example of analytical AI, which is already
shaking the financial services industry. However, some customers may be reluctant to start
using such a disruptive technology. To understand more about this underexplored field, we
investigated whether customers are ready to embrace robo-advisors. To that end, we
analyzed the extent to which the direct effect of technology readiness factors and awareness,
and the moderation effects of age, gender, previous experience and the FinTech advisor ’s
name influenced customers ’decisions to use analytical AI to manage their investments. This
is the first study to test the effects of technology readiness on consumers ’preferences for

analytical AI, which had been identified as a research gap ( Belanche et al., 2020a ;Mende et al.,
2019;van Doorn et al., 2017 ).
As a novel, important finding, technological discomfort, that is, the lack of control and
overwhelming complexity of technologies experienced by some customers, had a positive and
significant effect on intention to use robo-advisors. This result is particularly interesting
because technological discomfort was originally proposed as a TRI factor that inhibited
adoption ( Parasuraman, 2000 ;Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 ). Indeed, discomfort has been
shown to reduce the adoption of investment software among employees ( Walczuch et al. ,
2007). AI systems are based on automation, thus the user does not need to deal with the
demanding, and often problematic, tasks of understanding and operating the technology,
tasks that must be undertaken when using other systems; analytical AI carries out the tasks
for the user ( Belanche et al., 2020b ). Therefore, paradoxically, AI systems may be particularly
embraced by customers who suffer higher levels of technological discomfort because
automation removes the need for learning and dealing with awkward technological
processes. This finding provides a thought-provoking insight into the AI adoption literature
as customers may no longer need to play active roles in the service process. A theoretical
contribution of the present study is the finding that technological discomfort, previously
regarded as a key barrier to technology adoption, might act as a driver of acceptance. In turn,
several important drivers of adoption, such as the user ’s self-efficacy, or perceived control,
may act in the future as barriers to AI adoption (i.e. more skillful users might avoid using AI).
Furthermore, this finding questions some service-dominant logic value co-creation axioms
such as “The customer is always a co-creator of value ”, and that “Value is always uniquely
and phenomenologically determined by the beneficiary ”(Vargo and Lusch, 2016 , p. 8). In the
context of analytical AI robo-advisors, the customer no longer plays an active role, that is, the
technology creates the value. When frontline employees are replaced by automated agents
interacting socially with customers (e.g. assistive robots), the participation of the differentactors often leads to value co-creation (/C20Cai/C19cet al., 2018 ). However, when automated agents
replace the customers ’role because of their greater skills and performance, value is created
because of the customer ’s reduced participation. In other words, lower customer participation
and co-creation results in higher service value.
Turning to the other TRI variables ( Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 ), as hypothesized,
customers ’optimism had a positive impact, and insecurity had a negative impact, on robo-2.53.03.54.04.5

advisor adoption. In general, higher technology optimistic customers will be more likely to
use robo-advisors as they believe they will help them better perform their tasks and increase
their quality of life. Thus, our results suggested that having an overall positive opinion about
the benefits of technology encourages customers to embrace innovations, as was the case
with previous technologies when first launched onto the market ( Liljander et al., 2006 ). In
addition, optimism may be increasingly important in the post-COVID-19 era, during which
individuals perceived that robot and AI-based technologies increased their quality of life
(Gonz /C19alez-Jim /C19enez, 2020 ).
In turn, insecurity concerns reduced consumers ’behavioral intentions to use robo-
advisors. Thus, customers who worry about the harmful consequences of technologies, such
as increased technology dependence or reduced personal interaction quality, may avoid using
AI-based financial services. This finding is in line with recent research that has indicated
there is a need to explore people ’s fear of service robots and AI, especially when these
innovations have human skills or appearances ( Mende et al., 2019 ;Ransbotham et al., 2018 ).
Indeed, it seems that anxiety felt toward AI and robots will become a field of increasing
interest among scholars and should be added to the already wide body of knowledge about
customers ’awareness of the harmful consequences of technology (e.g. smartphone or social
media addiction ( Jiang et al., 2018 ;Sanz-Blas et al., 2019 )). An interesting moderating effect
observed was that insecurity inhibited behavioral intentions to use robo-advisors more
among customers without investment experience than among those with investment
experience. This finding suggests that investment experience lowers the barriers to
acceptance of this new technology; thus, experienced customers, who will be less troubled by
technology threats, may be a good target sector for robo-advisors. This finding is in line with
previous research that found that consumers must have confidence in both the vendor (firm)
and the technology to adopt new technology-based services ( Belanche et al., 2014 ) such as
robo-advisors ( Cheng et al., 2019 ).
In contrast, innovativeness did not have a significant direct effect on behavioral
intentions. That is, in general, customers ’technology innovativeness is not a critical driver of
robo-advisor adoption. Perhaps, in such an evolving market, the more innovative consumers
are looking for even more creative investment alternatives such as cryptocurrencies and/or
crowdfunding. To the extent that robo-advisors reduce the active role of customers through
technology, they may also attract less innovative customers. Nevertheless, the influence of
innovativeness is significant among men and exerts a positive effect on their intentions to userobo-advisors. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have suggested that
innovative men are more likely to use new service technologies ( Kalini /C19cet al. , 2019 ).
Therefore, innovative men may be a particularly fertile target segment for robo-advisor
service adoption.
In an additional theoretical contribution, we identified that customer awareness positively
influenced intention to use robo-advisors, shedding light on a factor ignored in the previous
technology adoption literature. Our study found that service awareness (i.e. being conscious
of and having knowledge of) significantly increased the acceptance of new and disruptive
services among many customer groups. The moderating effects observed revealed that
awareness is particularly important for younger customers and women. These findings align
with previous research; as women report lower levels of self-efficacy when dealing with new
technologies ( Sun and Zhang, 2006 ), awareness may be especially important for them as it
increases confidence in technologies. On the other hand, awareness is more important for
younger than for older customers. This may be because younger users are more autonomous
in their decision-making ( Sun and Zhang, 2006 ) and, thus, may rely to a greater extent on their
acquired knowledge, that is, awareness, to decide whether to adopt this new technology. This
finding is consistent with previous research into social communications which has suggested
that younger people and women tend to incorporate available social information into theirIntention to use

decision-making processes ( Sorce et al. , 2005 ;Burke, 2001 ). The study ’s post-hoc analysis
increased the understanding of how customers become aware of the existence of robo-
advisors, and to what extent this information affects use intentions. These findings
contribute to the existing knowledge in the field as previous studies have found that
subjective norms (i.e. other ’s opinions) affect robo-advisor adoption ( Belanche et al., 2019 );
however, we identified that when customers become aware of robo-advisors through their
own means, or directly from their banks, they are more likely to adopt the service. In addition,
the results of the post-hoc analysis revealed that for customers ’who were previously aware of
these services, the name “AI-advisor ”created higher use intention than did the name “robo-
advisor ”. Thus, although the standard industry name, robo-advisor, may be effective with
first-time users, those with previous knowledge of these FinTech initiatives were more
attracted by the term “AI-advisor ”.
The control variables included in the model also affected customers ’intentions to use
robo-advisors. As proposed in technology adoption models (e.g. the TAM; Davis, 1989 ),
customers ’perceptions of robo-advisors as easy to use and useful increased their behavioral
intentions. Customers tend to use technologies that perform well and do not require too much
effort to operate. These effects are consistent with those observed in previous research
(Bhattacherjee, 2000 ;Belanche et al. , 2019 ), and can be understood in economic terms as
customers ’decisions in financial markets are often based on the cost-benefit paradigm,
including nonmonetary and psychological costs ( Lee and Cunningham, 2001 ). As to the direct
effects of demographic factors, older customers had lower use intention. This finding is
consistent with previous research that indicated that older customers have more negative
attitudes toward online-based services and service robots ( Hudson et al., 2017 ;Onorato, 2018 ).
Thus, our study confirms that robo-advisors are more likely to be popular among younger
users, and that older consumers may prefer traditional financial advice channels ( Woodyard
and Grable, 2018 ). Our results also suggested that men and women are equally inclined to use
robo-advisors. Although the previous literature has found that women have more negative
attitudes than men toward technological services ( Chen and Huang, 2016 ), this was not the
case in this analysis of a representative sample of North American men and women. Finally,
we found that prior investment experience did not affect customers ’intention to use
automated financial advisors. Perhaps customers with previous experience feel they do not
need to switch to FinTech alternatives. In any case, these findings reinforced the proposals
that robo-advisors democratize access to financial investment services ( Belanche et al. ,
2020a ), and that FinTech services should be oriented toward both men and women, with or
without previous investment experience.
6.2 Managerial implications
Banks and financial service providers are introducing robo-advisors to achieve competitive
advantage based on economies of scale and scope ( Wirtz et al. , 2018 ). Our findings to a
significant extent explain customers ’intention to use robo-advisors and have interesting
practical implications, not only for financial services ’managers but also for companies
seeking to introduce AI technologies into their service offerings. Potential customers need to
perceive robo-advisors as easy to use and useful for their financial management. Providing
clear instructions and user-friendly apps to help customers start using these innovations
could increase ease of use perceptions. Undertaking trial programs and providing statistics
about robo-advisors ’performance may also enhance perceived usefulness.
Technology readiness plays a crucial role, but managers should pay more attention to
customer characteristics that have been shown to form intention to use robo-advisors.
Specifically, banks and other financial firms should focus on customers with higher levels of
technological optimism as potential users of robo-advisor services. To identify customers
with this profile, companies should identify individuals who are enthusiastic about the use ofJOSM

technological services. They could do this through normal market research techniques, for
example, customer surveys, CRM and big data analytics (e.g. linked to customers ’activity on
social media). Communication campaigns using celebrities and/or influencers with multiple
followers based on their technology optimism (e.g. YouTube gaming influencers) could help
attract customers through social media.
Customers with higher technology discomfort may be more likely to adopt robo-advisor
services. Banks and finance companies should focus on customers who are interested in
making investments, but who do not want to undertake the complicated task of managing
their own investments using complex software and/or who want to avoid the fees and time
involved in interacting with human financial advisors. In this instance, robo-advisors would
fulfill the tasks of analytical AI, that is, helping and supporting less skilled customers using
the newest technological advances in the sector ( Huang and Rust, 2018 ). These customers
might be identified by seeking out those who abandon managing their investments (e.g. due
to complexity) and/or who informally complain about the difficulties of operating other
technological banking systems. Robo-advisor communication campaigns should favorably
contrast the service to human financial advisory services (e.g. “to avoid high fees ”) and to
customer self-management (e.g. “let AI do the work ”).
The moderation results of the study indicated that customer innovativeness may be
particularly significant in terms of robo-advisor use by men. Segmentation strategies based
on online navigation cookies, programmatic advertising and internal CRM software should
be combined to focus on innovative male customers. Managers might also use cross-selling
techniques in collaboration with leading, groundbreaking technological brands (e.g. Apple,
Amazon Alexa) and with companies focused on innovative users (e.g. IBM and Uber) to target
this customer group.
Managers should also focus on customers ’perceptions of technology insecurity as a key
inhibitor of robo-advisor use intention, sp ecifically among less experienced investors.
Robo-advisors could be offered preferent ially to customers with lower levels of
technological insecurity; these might be i dentified through surveys or other market
research techniques. Alternat ively, finance industry com panies should try to reduce
insecurity by better explaining how robo-advisors work, why they are reliable (e.g. AI
ensures privacy and data protection ( Mazurek and Ma łagocka, 2019 )) and how financial
risks might be limited. Training programs that offer small monetary investments and sign-
on bonuses may reduce the initial wariness ab out robo-advisors among inexperienced
investors.
As to awareness, the industry should make greater efforts to spread knowledge about
robo-advisors, how they function and their benefits. Banks and other financial firms should
use direct communications to promote these services as these have been shown to be more
effective than advertising and mass media communication. In addition, they should
encourage customers to increase their knowledge about robo-advisors through their own
means (e.g. detailed information on the web and trial programs). As a complementary,
effective marketing action, managers should develop “bring a friend ”campaigns to
encourage more experienced users of robo-advisors to recommend them to other customers.
Finally, our study revealed that younger customers are more willing to use robo-advisors.
It should be easy for companies to address this customer segment as age is basic information
contained in CRM systems. In particular, employees such as bank tellers and financial
advisors should recommend robo-advisors to younger customers in their discussions about
the bank ’s services, for example, about which channels to use. Nevertheless, although in this
initial stage, robo-advisors may be preferred by the young, analytical AI and automated
forms of financial management must be taken up by a wide spectrum of customers if
companies are to take advantage of economies of scale and scope ( Kumar et al., 2019 ;Wirtz
et al., 2018 ).Intention to use

6.3 Limitations and further research
The present study has several limitations. To test the effect of technology readiness on use
intentions we used the TRI ( Parasuraman, 2000 ;Parasuraman and Colby, 2015 ). Although the
TRI is the most accepted framework through which to analyze consumers ’technology readiness,
alternative models with slightly different components might be tested (e.g. compatibility ( Moore
and Benbasat, 1991 ), trust ( Robinson et al., 2020 ) and creepiness ( Ostrom et al., 2019 )). Although
the TRI factors may overlap with some of these variables ( Liljander et al., 2006 ), alternative
measures directlyrelated to the financial market could beemployed ( Lee and Cunningham, 2001 ).
Similarly, further research is needed to clarify the influence of customers ’technological readiness
on AI adoption in other sectors (e.g. health, education and tourism) ( Yoganathan et al.,2 0 2 1 ). The
important role of awareness in adoption may vary as time passes. In particular, as robo-advisor
use increases, customers will develop greater knowledge, which will increase awareness among
their peers (e.g. word-of-mouth and consumer reco mmendations). Therefore, longitudinal studies
may help explain how the role of awareness evolves over time.
Another limitation is that our study is based on a sample of North Americans, who tend to
score lower in uncertainty avoidance ( Hofstede, 2011 ) than most European and Asian
consumers. Thus, the research should be replicated in other countries to assess how cultural
dimensions may affect robo-advisor adoption ( Belanche et al., 2019 ). Although the term robo-
advisor seems to be the more popular worldwide, further research should be conducted to
assess whether another name (e.g. AI-advisor or an alternative), or even a specific brand-
related name, may enhance customers ’perceptions of these analytical AI services. Similarly,
increasing the customer ’s perception of humanness, for example, by representing the robo-
advisor as a humanoid ( Yoganathan et al. , 2021 ;Belanche et al. , 2021 ), might have a
significant impact on acceptance; this merits further research.
The robo-advisor phenomenon should be analyzed within the broader scope of AI, its
ethical limits and the need for regulation of such innovative systems ( Robinson et al., 2020 ).
The moderating effects we found suggest that individuals ’optimism may be crucial for
motivating usage. Nevertheless, people ’s concerns with technology (i.e. insecurity) and, in
particular, feelings of anxiety in relation to automated forms of interaction (particularly
among less experienced customers), deserve further research attention. Finally, the study
revealed that, paradoxically, customers with higher technological discomfort are more
willing to embrace AI-based services. Contrary to co-creation axioms that suggest that
technologies require higher user participation and ability, AI could be specifically designedfor less skilled users. Thus, AI would fulfill its original purpose, that is, to use technological
capacities to help humans, especially those who lack skills and/or are less efficient ( Huang
and Rust, 2018 ;Belanche et al., 2020a ). Investigating discomfort, and other human limitations,
that have previously been regarded as barriers to technology adoption, but which may now
be contributing to adoption, is a promising future research avenue.
