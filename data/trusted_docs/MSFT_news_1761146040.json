  "summary": "When a company that hasn’t posted a quarterly profit in more than five years surges more than 140% in a day, and the world’s benchmark flight-to-safety asset falls the most in five years, it is safe to say there is something weird happening in financial markets.  Stock in the plant-based food company is now trading more than 700% north of last week’s closing prices.  Gold’s recent record-setting rally, and this week’s near 8% slump, also suggest there has been a level of FOMO, or fear of missing out, that has led risk-seeking investors into different corners of the market in search for the next big move.",
