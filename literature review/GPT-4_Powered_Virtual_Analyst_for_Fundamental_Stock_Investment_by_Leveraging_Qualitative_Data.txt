I.INTRODUCTION 
Investing in the stock market offers an opportunity to 
supplement income. However, haphazard investments without 
thorough research can lead to financial losses. To enhance 
their chances of selecting stocks that will appreciate in value, 
individuals typical ly adopt one of two approaches: self -
learning investment strategies or seeking the expertise of a 
fund manager. Self -learning requires investing a significant 
amount of time in reading reports, studying the prospects of 
listed companies, and attending inve stment training courses if 
necessary. On the other hand, hiring a fund manager to 
oversee investments usually involves substantial fees and is 
suitable only for the investors with large capital. Hence, these 
two approaches have their own limitations. 
A more balanced approach that offers an efficient and 
economical way to enhance investment strategies is the 
conceptualization of a virtual analyst , which is the core of our 
proposed system. Rather than fully committing to studying 
stocks independently or relying solely on a fund manager, we propose exploring simpler methods, with the assistance of AI, 
for beginners to select suitable stocks. This approach 
leverages the advantages of both self -learning and expert 
guidance while mitigating their limitations .
The goal of this study is to develop a tool that enhances 
stock investment strategies from a fundamental perspective. 
This is achieved by leveraging Generative AI, such as 
ChatGPT, to analyze qualitative information, including 
company strategies, market insights, and government policies, 
to ensure that the investment recommendations made by the 
tool are fact -based and well -founded.  The ultimate objective 
is to assist both novice and experienced investors in 
fundamental stock investment at a low cost. By using the 
historical data of selected stocks in Bursa Malaysia (the 
Malaysian Stock Market), our experiments show that the 
recommendations made by our system are valid for up to ten 
months, which is sufficient for value investing.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, the related works are presented. We discuss the 
proposed idea and methodology in Section III. In Section IV, 
we compare the recommendations made by our system, based 
on the historical info rmation (past news, reports, policies, etc), 
with the price movement of selected stocks, and show that the 
recommendations are valid for up to ten months. Finally, 
conclusions and future works will be discussed in Session V.
II.RELATED WORK
A.Investment Therories
To analyze stock performance, researchers have 
developed various theories. For example, the Efficient Market 
Hypothesis (EMH) assumes that in an efficient market, all the 
market information related to a stock will be fully reflected in 
the stock’s price [1]. However, perfect market efficiency is an 
ideal assumption and does not always hold true in real -world 
scenario, leading some experts to disagree with EMH. 
On the other hand, the Adaptive Market Hypothesis 
(AMH) is a more realistic theory that suggests market 
efficiency changes due to investor behaviours. It also indicates 
that the market does not strictly follow the economic 
principles but can be influenced by investor psychology. 
AMH proposes that market conditions evolve, allowing 2024 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences (AiDAS) | 979-8-3315-2855-3/24/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/AIDAS63860.2024.10730589

2024 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences (AiDAS)— 305 —fundamental analysis to identify mispricing as markets adjust 
to new information. Furthermore, AMH supports the idea that 
patterns and trends resulting from investor behaviour can be 
identified and exploited through technical analysis, thereby 
aligning bot h fundamental and technical analysis with the 
adaptive nature of markets. 
In short, many factors can affect the stock prices, typically 
categorized into economic and non- economic factors. 
However, it is widely accepted among experts that long -term 
stock price movements are intrinsically linked to the 
fundamentals of the stock.
B.Quantitative Data Analysis
Most deep learning algorithms for predicting stock prices 
rely on quantitative data. The survey papers [1], [2], and [3] 
discuss various models used for stock market prediction, 
highlighting their strengths and limitations. Artificial Neural 
Networks (ANNs ) identify relationships between stock factors 
but require more relevant technical indicators to improve 
accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) enhance predictive 
accuracy but lack versatility and advanced feature extraction 
capabilities. Decision Support Systems (DSS) benefit from 
incorporating soft computing techniques to improve accuracy. 
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) need to account for 
correlations between variables for better predictions. Support 
Vector Machi nes (SVMs) and Support Vector Regression 
(SVRs) should include macroeconomic factors to enhance 
their predictive power. Filtering methods require statistical 
tests to avoid data snooping bias, and fuzzy logic models 
should incorporate additional variables and techniques to 
handle non- stationary data. Optimization -based approaches 
benefit from advanced algorithms and data discretization 
methods. 
Recently, an innovative method for predicting stock 
markets has emerged, leveraging generative AI with 
quantitative data. Chang Che and his team [4] utilized 
generative AI to replicate financial market data production 
mechanism. They applied a conditional generative adversarial 
network (cGAN) to generate synthetic financial data that 
accurately reflects the statistical properties of real market data. 
By using USD/JPY transaction data, which includes daily 
trading volume, opening price, highest price, lowest price, and 
closing price, the cGAN was able to create data that closely 
mimics actual market patterns. This technique enables 
generative AI to provide reliable predictions and insights, 
aiding investors and policymakers in making well -informed 
decisions i n the financial market. However, the approach is 
devised for forex trading and disregards the fundamentals 
behind exchange rate movements.
Overall, integrating more sophisticated models and 
techniques can enhance the performance and versatility of 
these stock market prediction systems. However, for value 
investing, a thorough understanding of a stock's fundamentals 
is crucial. This requires qualitative information about 
companies, such as the nature of the business, the quality of 
management, and government policies, in addition to 
quant itative data like return on equity (ROE) and dividends. 
Thus, t he aforementioned deep learning methods are 
inadequate for conducting qualitative analysis of stock 
fundamentals.C.Qualitative Data Analysis
In the earlier days, generative AI was predominantly used 
for sentiment analysis, a key aspect of qualitative data 
analysis, to interpret and quantify sentiments expressed in 
textual data sources such as news articles and financial 
forums.
In [5], Lopez- Lira and Tang developed a ChatGPT -based 
sentiment analysis and linear regression model to predict 
short -term stock prices using CRSP daily returns and news 
headlines. Their model demonstrated a strong correlation 
between ChatGPT sentiment scores and next -day stock 
returns, outperforming other sentiment analysis methods. 
They suggest potential improvements with a hybrid system. In
[6], Steinert and Altmann used GPT -4 and BERT for 
sentiment analysis on Stocktwits messages to predict Apple 
and T esla's daily stock movements in 2017 ,finding GPT -4
outperformed BERT with better capture of nuanced 
sentiments and financial terminology. However, GPT -4's high 
deployment cost is a concern for practical use. Additionally, 
all the predictions focus on short -term stock market 
movements rather than fundamental analysis. The inputs used 
for analysis are limited to sources such as news headlines and 
forum data. These data sources capture market sentiment, 
which is more relevant to short -term investment prospect s as 
they reflect investor behavior sand responses to immediate 
market movements.
Additionally, Udit Gupta developed GPT -InvestAR, a tool 
that assists in analyzing annual reports using ChatGPT [7]. It 
converts the detailed textual content of these reports into a 
structured dataset containing key financial metrics and 
sentiments about the company's performance and prospects. 
By combining this dataset with historical stock price data, the 
researchers developed a machine learning model to predict 
stock performance. The results were promising, showing that 
the model could outperform the S&P 500 index in return 
predictions. However, relying solely on annual reports is 
insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of a company's 
performance and future prospects.
Studies have demonstrated that a Large Language Model 
(LLM), such as ChatGPT, has the potential to analyze 
qualitative data in the stock market. Our idea is to leverage 
various qualitative data sources such as annual reports, 
quarterly reports, company new s, and government policies to 
conduct fundamental analysis on companies. This approach 
aims to overcome the limitations of solely relying on 
quantitative analysis. By incorporating these diverse data 
sources, we can provide comprehensive recommendations a nd 
justifications for not only short -term but also medium and 
long-term investment prospects.
III.METHODOLODY
To realize the concept of a virtual analyst, we will train 
GPT -4 from OpenAI to analyze financial qualitative data and 
provide numerical ratings along with justifications to users. 
This approach is necessary because, while GPT -4 possesses 
broad general kno wledge, it may lack deep expertise in the 
stock market investment and does not have real -time access to 
the relevant data.
As depicted in Fig .1, the system's workflow is divided into 
two segments: admin and user. The admin segment, 
highlighted in light red, involves acquiring and preprocessing 
data, managing databases, and refining the model to enhance

light blue, focuses on user interaction with the system via the 
GUI, allowing users to explore and gather information about 
various company stocks.
Fig. 1. System ’sWorkflow.
A.Data Sources
The system gathers information from four primary 
sources: company news, annual reports, quarterly reports, and 
national policies. To streamline the collection process, we use 
web scraping tools to efficiently gather data from the Internet. 
While these four sources are essential for the analysis, the 
system is designed to be expandable, allowing the 
incorporation of additional data sources to enhance the 
accuracy of its recommendations.
B.Data Pre -processing
To handle the qualitative data, we utilize GPT -4 to 
summarize the data by configuring specific tasks for it to 
complete. Instead of completing all tasks on the "Model" 
depicted in Fig .1, we have opted to distribute the tasks across 
multiple GPTs to preprocess the data before it serves as input 
for analysis. This approach not only reduces the number of 
input tokens required but also lowers the costs associated with 
calling the GPTs. We h ave designated four separate GPTs to 
handle distinct tasks, as follows :
i. Summarized Annual Report
In the company annual report, we concentrate on three 
principal sections: the board of directors, the chairman's 
statements, and the management discussion and analysis. For 
the board of directors, the designated GPT is tasked with 
retrieving their names and respective roles. In the chairman's 
statements, the GPT focuses on extracting insights about the 
company's performance, strategic direction, governance 
practices, challenges and opportunities, future prospects, 
sustai nability, risk management, industry trends and 
competitive landscape. The management discussion and
analysis covers similar areas as the chairman's statement but 
also includes detailed evaluations of their business segments 
and annual performance. This structured format will facilitate 
efficient storage in our database.
ii. Credibility Analysis
Credibility analysis is conducted to verify whether the 
management or chairman of a company has met their stated 
targets. For example, if the chairman commits to digitalizing 
operations but no digitalization efforts are evident in the 
following year, this will reflect poorly on their credibility. To perform this analysis effectively, it is essential to review 
multiple years of annual reports to check the consistency of 
their stated goals against actual achievements. In our system, 
the input consists of mult iple years of annual reports. The GPT 
is tasked with extracting forward -looking statements, 
challenges faced, any subsequent follow -through, and the 
implementation of future directions. The output will provide 
an analysis of the implementation of future di rections, 
interpretation of sentiments, and the challenges and solutions 
identified. 
iii. Competitive Analysis
The purpose of conducting competitive analysis is to enhance 
the realism of our results. Focusing solely on the selected 
company might not provide sufficient insight into its industry 
positioning. By comparing strengths and weaknesses relative 
to its competito rs, users gain a clearer understanding of the 
company's competitive landscape. However, in our system, 
competitors are manually identified, and typically only one or 
two are shortlisted for comparison . We utilize the latest 
quarterly reports to assess current industry performance , adapt 
credibility analysis to evaluate the integrity of management, 
and review recent news to compare their current activities. 
The GPT is tasked with comparing the selected company and 
its competitors by assessing their market position, 
performance, fin ancial status, strategic initiatives, credibility, 
and risk. The output will be a performance ranking within the 
industry, ranging from 1 (highest) to 2 or 3 (lowest). Each 
ranking will be accompanied by a detailed justification,
providing clear insights based on the comparative analysis.
iv. National Policy Analysis
To perform market analysis for a country , we focus on policies 
with the highest impact and attention from both the 
government and investors, rather than studying all policies 
from various departments. However, we encountered 
challenges due to the broad scope of these policies, which may 
lead GPT -4 to randomly select from a wide range of targeted 
industri es for prediction. For instance, "Policy X" covers 
sectors like aerospace, food processing, and automotive. To 
enhance our analysis, we incorporate " Progres sNews" to 
provide current context. For example, "Company Y" 
announces the construction of its largest 3D chip packaging 
facility in a particular city, this information is relevant to the 
semiconductor sector included in "Policy X". Integrating 
policy analysi s with recent developments allows the model to 
identify and predict market trends more accurately.
C.Model
The GPT API will be the core model in our system, 
utilized to analyze data and provide recommendations with 
supportive evidence to users. This choice is based on its 
proven results and capabilities ,as demonstrated in other
research . However, cost considerations are significant, as the 
GPT -4 Turbo API model costs $0.01 per 1000 tokens for 
input and $0.03 per 1000 tokens for output. This expense is 
relatively high compared to other models, necessitating 
careful pricing strategies for deployment.
Additionally, the model is designed to operate like a 
virtual skilled investment analyst, primarily processing 
qualitative data from various sources such as the latest annual 
reports, the most recent quarterly reports, credibility 
analy zes, competitor analysis, and trends in the country. It 
leverages its database, with the current knowledge cut -off for

— 307 —the GPT -4 Turbo Model being December 2023. The model is 
programmed to carefully consider factors such as leadership 
changes, market position, and management credibility while 
focusing on generating clear and actionable investment 
recommendations. The model 's outputs are categorized into 
three -time frames: short- term (3 -6 months), medium -term (6 
months to 1 year), and long -term ( 1year onwards ). Each 
period concentrates on distinct aspects such as recent 
financials for the short term, market positioning and 
credibility analysis for the medium term, and strategic 
initiatives and business alignment with the trends for the long 
term. The system issues recommendation ratings on a scale 
from 0 to 10, accompanied by supporting evidence, and 
includes an assessment o f the company's credibility.
Moreover, we demonstrate that ChatGPT can embody 
distinct perspectives , opening new avenues for research into 
how different experts might interpret the same information 
differently. By configuring ChatGPT with both optimistic 
and pessimistic versions, we allow it to analyze data from 
these differing viewpoints. For example, the headline 
“Company A Continues to Cut Prices Across Its Car Range” 
might be viewed by an optimistic analyst as a sign of 
Company A's manufacturing efficiency and market 
confidence. In contrast, a pessimistic analyst might interpret 
it as an indication of demand issues and potential profitability 
challenges.
The optimistic analyzer (GPT) will emphasize positive 
aspects of information, such as financial growth, potential for 
increased demand, and a generally positive long- term 
outlook. On the other hand, the pessimistic analyzer focuses 
on identifying management vulnerabilities, exploring 
potential risks to the company, and critically assessing 
whether the company is truly prepared to scale production to 
meet increasing market demands, despite alignment with 
current trends. These two approaches provide distinctl y
contrasting perspectives on the same data.
D.Model Configurations
When using the GPT API, an important parameter to 
consider is "temperature," which controls the randomness or 
creativity of the model's responses. This parameter is set as a 
numerical value typically ranging from 0 to 2. A low 
temperature, closer to 0, res ults in more deterministic, 
consistent, and predictable responses, making it ideal for 
tasks requiring high precision and minimal variability. 
Conversely, a high temperature, closer to 2, makes the 
model's responses more varied, random, and creative. This 
setting allows the model to produce a broader array of outputs 
and engage in more experimental language generation, which 
is beneficial for creative tasks or scenarios where exploring 
diverse response options is preferred.
In our system, we assign different temperature settings to 
different GPTs based on the tasks they perform. For instance, 
for all data preprocessing tasks, the temperature is set to 0. 
This ensures that the responses are strictly factual and 
reliable, avoid ing any generation of inaccurate or fabricated 
content. For interactive sessions where users consult the 
analyzer (GPT), we set the temperature to 0.2. This allows for 
responses that are primarily based on factual justifications, 
while still permitting a s light degree of creative interpretation 
in the answers provided. By implementing these temperature 
settings, we ensure our system's reliability, delivering fact-
based analysis rather than speculative content.Additionally, we have structured the prompts for the 
analyzer (GPT) to follow step -by-step instructions set by 
either the admin or the user, allowing for customization based 
on specific user requirements. The prompt system includes 
two distinct roles: the "system role" and the "user role." The 
system role provides instructions and rules for the GPT, 
ensuring it adheres to the desired guidelines. The user role 
represents the person interacting with the GPT, similar to how 
users typically interact with ChatG PT. We propose a 
structured format to ensure our analysis is consistent, resulting 
in uniformly structured and reliable outputs. For the system 
role, we focus on analyzing different terms and require a 
numerical rating for each one. For the user role, we e mphasize 
providing relevant data inputs and any additional information 
GPT needs to consider, while clearly defining the desired 
output format. The general format is illustrated in Fig. 2 
(System role) and Fig. 3 (User role).
Fig. 2. Prompt Structured Format of System Role .
Fig. 3. Prompt Structured Format of User Role.
IV.RESULT
Before evaluating the results, it is crucial to ensure that all 
justifications generated by GPT are fact -based rather than 
speculative, guaranteeing the system's reliability at 100%. To 
achieve this, we utilize a lower temperature setting, as 
mentioned earlier.
To evaluate the numerical ratings and their corresponding 
justifications, we verify their accuracy in predicting future 
outcomes. Our evaluation method involves selecting a past 
period and instructing GPT to forecast a future period. We 
then compare these predictions with actual stock price data to 
determine their accuracy. For example, we choose January 1, 
2018, as the benchmark date and predict stock performance 
over the next five years, ending on December 31, 2022. We 
also select companies within the sam e sector to evaluate the 
competitive landscape among them.
A.Terms Evaluation
The evaluation process encompasses three distinct terms: 
short -term (3 to 6 months), medium -term (6 months to 1 
year), and long -term (1 year and beyond). This analysis 
employs two types of GPT analyzers: the optimistic analyzer,

— 308 —and the pessimistic analyzer, which both emphasize different 
aspects, as discussed previously. Users can refer to the 
summary rating table generated by both analyzers, as each 
provides a different range of ratings. These ratings classify 
company ’ssituation as negative ,neutral, or positive.
TABLE I. REFERENCES OF RATING CATEGORIES 
Type of Analyzers
(GPTs)Rating Categories
Negative Neutral Positive
Optimistic 0 -5 6 -7 8 -10
Pessimistic 0 -4 5 -6 7 -10
Our experiments indicate that the pessimistic analyzer tends 
to reflect reality more accurately, as its predictions align more 
closely with actual stock prices compared to the optimistic 
version. Hence, our team recommends using the pessimistic 
analyzer for more reliable justification, as it provides a more 
realistic assessment of potential risks and challenges faced by 
the companies.
Examples of the rating categories using the pessimistic 
analyzer are as follows (Note: Company names will be 
replaced with letters):
i. Positive & Neutral ( Company P )
According to the short -term investment prospects, GPT 
assigned a rating of 7 to Company P, predicting a positive 
performance within 3 to 6 months. This is supported by the 
actual stock price data: starting at RM 5.20 on January 1, 
2018, and rising to RM 5. 97 by June 30, 2018, indicating an 
increase that aligns with GPT's analysis. 
Aside from the positive category, there is the neutral 
category as shown in the medium -term outlook of company P. 
GPT assigned a rating of 6, reflecting a neutral stance on the 
company's performance over the second half of the year. GPT 
noted potential challenges the company might face and 
suggested monitoring the company's response to these 
situations. The stock price remained relatively stable around 
RM 5.80 throughout the second half of the year, with no 
significant increase or decrease until a notable drop in 
December, which was not accurately predicted. The 
references are shown in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4. References of Company P Investment Prospects & Stock Price
ii. Neutral (Company Q )For the short -term outlook, GPT assigned a rating of 6 to 
Company Q, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses. 
This resulted in a neutral market stance, reflected in the stock 
price remaining stable at RM 0.07 from the beginning to the 
end of the sho rt term. In the medium -term outlook, GPT 
maintained its neutral attitude towards Company Q. 
According to GPT's justification, it believes that Company Q 
has growth potential but is not yet ready to fully capitalize on 
it. The stock price remained at RM 0. 07 at the end of 2018, 
accurately reflecting GPT's prediction. The references are 
shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5. References of Company Q Investment Prospects & Stock Price
iii. Negative (Company R )
GPT assigned a short -term rating of 3 to Company R due 
to a revenue drop and increased internal costs. This rating is 
validated by the decline in stock price from RM 1.47 to RM 
1.17 over six months. For the medium -term outlook, GPT also 
gave a negative rat ing, primarily due to concerns about the 
effectiveness of the company's strategies and the competitive 
landscape. This negative outlook was further confirmed as the 
stock price dropped from RM 1.17 to RM 0.62 by the end of 
the year. The references are sho wn in Fig. 6 .

— 309 —B.Competitive Landscape Evaluation
The competitive analysis examines the recent performance of 
companies relative to their industry competitors, similar to 
the short -term analysis. GPT ranked Company P the highest, 
followed by Company R, and then Company Q, based on 
their recent performance . This ranking is supported by the 
actual short -term stock price results. As shown in Fig. 7, 
Company P's stock price increased, Company R's stock price 
remained stable, and Company Q's stock price declined. 
These results align with GPT's rankings.
Fig. 7. References of Company P, Q, R’s Stock Price in Short Term Period
C.Long Term Investment Evaluation
One evaluation example is Company R, as shown in Fig. 8. 
GPT provided a neutral rating for Company R, 
acknowledging its growth potential but maintaining a neutral 
stance due to its historically poor performance. However, the 
actual results showed that the company experienced growth, 
with its stock price increasing over the five years from 2018. 
This outcome contrasts with GPT's in itial justification.
Fig. 8. References of Company R Investment Prospects & Stock Price in 
Long TermBased on observations, mis -justification primarily occurs in 
most companies due to the challenge of using initial data to 
predict outcomes beyond one year. This difficulty arises from 
the multitude of unexpected variables or incidents that can 
occur over t ime. However, our system can provide more 
reliable recommendations for up to ten months without 
continuous monitoring, relying solely on initial data.
Continuous monitoring of stock investments is crucial due to 
the inherent market volatility, where stock prices can change 
rapidly in response to market conditions, economic events, 
and shifts in investor sentiment. This volatility makes it 
challenging to accurately predict and provide 
recommendations based solely on initial data.
V.CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present an innovative method for making 
informed stock investments that goes beyond the traditional 
options of self -learning or hiring fund managers. Our system 
leverages qualitative data to complement and address the 
limitations of quantitative -only approaches. By integrating 
company information with the capabilities of the GPT model, 
our system provides reliable investment justifications for up 
to ten months without requiring continuous updates. This 
approach offers significant time and cost savings, making it an 
efficient and effective tool for investors. 
To improve our system, we plan to implement 
notifications to alert users of database updates, enabling 
continuous stock market monitoring. We will incorporate 
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to automate 
data extraction from PDFs, making the information more 
accessible. Additionally, we willintegrate global market data
for comprehensive analysis and expand our capabilities by 
analyzing a company's customer base and its revenue 
relationship, providing new analytical insights .
