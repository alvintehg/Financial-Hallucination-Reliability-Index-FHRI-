ABSTRACT
Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise cal-
culation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis,
since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making
and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique re-
quirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and
proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks
rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable
framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs,
conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a
novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strat-
egy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P
500 annual reports;1and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic
hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabu-
lar data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house
LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more
trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

1 INTRODUCTION
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming fi-
nancial services through capabilities such as automated information
extraction [ 4] and client-facing chatbots [ 16], their deployment also
introduces substantial risks, among which hallucination poses seri-
ous threats to decision-making and stakeholder trust [ 8,19–22]. In
response, regulators such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) have underscored the need for robust model risk manage-
ment frameworks tailored to advanced AI applications [ 15]. Despite
growing regulatory scrutiny, systematic methods for evaluating
and mitigating hallucinations in financial contexts remain largely

able, comprehensive framework for evaluating and analyzing LLM
hallucinations in finance, quantifies how increasing information-
extraction complexity exacerbates hallucination errors, and offers
actionable guidance for researchers and practitioners.
This paper focuses on intrinsic hallucinations—a form of LLM
error where the generated output is inconsistent with the provided
input context [ 3]. Many financial tasks require precise extraction,
summarization, calculation, interpretation, and reasoning based on
structured inputs such as financial tables. Errors in these processes
can significantly undermine decision-making. Intrinsic hallucina-
tions are already concerning in such cases; when LLMs rely instead
on web search results or internal knowledge rather than the ac-
tual financial input, the risk of hallucination becomes even greater.
Undetected hallucinations can propagate through complex, auto-
mated systems, leading to misleading analyses, flawed investment
strategies, or regulatory breaches.
Yet, evaluating hallucinations in a systemic and robust approach
is a non-trivial challenge, mainly due to the lack of finance-specific
hallucination evaluation datasets. Most existing datasets are de-
rived from general-domain texts such as Wikipedia [ 3,6], whereas
financial applications often involve complex, numerically grounded
data - including tables, charts, and document inputs - and require
specialized reasoning and contextual understanding. More impor-
tantly, there is a clear need for an automated and scalable approach
to creating evaluation datasets for hallucination detection in real-
world financial settings. Manual annotation is resource-intensive
and can hardly keep up with evolving LLM behaviors or the di-
versity of proprietary financial data. Thus, inspired by recent ad-
vancements [ 7,12,26], our study addresses this gap by proposing a
rigorous and scalable methodology that uses actual financial annual
reports—where ground truth values are explicitly known—to au-
tomatically construct benchmarking tasks for evaluating intrinsic
hallucinations in financial LLM applications.
In this study, we address a core challenge in financial LLM appli-
cations: accurately identifying, calculating, and presenting numeri-
cal values based on financial statements (input context). We intro-
duce a novel context-aware masked span prediction task, where
numerical values from real annual reports are masked and LLMs
are prompted to recover them. To ensure reliable evaluation, wearXiv:2508.05201v1  [cs.LG]  7 Aug 2025

develop a novel filtering method that selects only those values
with a unique, consistent, and answerable ground truth. A cen-
tral contribution is our taxonomy of four mutually exclusive and
exhaustive financial reasoning types: Direct Lookup ,Comparative
Calculation (The value is a function of the same variable in dif-
ferent periods, e.g., year-over-year growth), Bivariate Calculation
(the value is a function of two variables, e.g., gross margin), and
Multivariate Calculation (more complex dependencies). This classi-
fication enables structured evaluation across reasoning complexity.
Using our approach, we build a large-scale benchmark dataset from
S&P 500 annual reports and evaluate leading LLMs on their intrinsic
hallucination rates. Results show that even top models frequently
hallucinate, especially on complex tasks.
Our work provides an essential foundation for evaluating hallu-
cinations in finance, a critical first step before effective mitigation.
The main contributions are as follows:
•We propose a novel and scalable paradigm for dataset cre-
ation based on a masking strategy, enabling automatic con-
struction of evaluation datasets for both public and propri-
etary financial documents.
•We release a new dataset for evaluating intrinsic hallucina-
tions in finance, with varying reasoning complexities.
•We conduct a comprehensive analysis of intrinsic hallucina-
tion patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular
data, including a detailed breakdown by reasoning type.
2 RELATED WORKS
2.1 Hallucination Evaluation Datasets
LLM hallucinations can be categorized as extrinsic or intrinsic,
based on the reference source [ 3]. The evaluation of extrinsic hal-
lucinations assesses whether a model’s output, generated from
its internal knowledge alone, aligns with established world facts.
Benchmarks in this category [ 10,11,13] generally evaluate mod-
els against static, open-domain corpora like Wikipedia. Financial
LLMs, however, operate in a domain where information is highly
time-sensitive, context-intensive, and often proprietary, requiring
evaluation methods that prioritize contextual accuracy over pre-
trained, parametric knowledge [8, 19–22].
Therefore, intrinsic hallucination evaluation is more relevant and
critical for financial applications, as it directly measures a model’s
faithfulness to a specific, provided context. While intrinsic evalu-
ation datasets have emerged, especially for Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) applications [ 6,14,17], those based on general-
purpose text, mostly are limited to simple look-up tasks rather than
complex reasoning [2, 17].
Our work addresses this critical gap, focusing on intrinsic hallu-
cinations within complex financial tabular data—a unique and high-
stakes domain largely overlooked by current evaluation method-
ologies.
2.2 Tabular Reasoning and Evaluation
Our focus on intrinsic hallucinations with tables connects to the
broader research area of tabular reasoning. Foundational bench-
marks such as RealHiTBench [24] and TableBench [25] have been
pivotal in assessing core LLM skills like numerical reasoning. In
the more intricate financial domain, specialized benchmarks haveemerged to address higher complexity. Datasets like FinQA [5] and
TAT-QA [30] test joint reasoning over tables and text, while others
focus on navigating complex hierarchical structures [9, 23, 27].
While these benchmarks have significantly advanced LLM rea-
soning capabilities, their evaluation scope is primarily focused on
the correctness of the final answer. This focus on accuracy creates
a critical blind spot: as task complexity increases, so does the risk
that a model generates a correct-seeming output through unfaithful
reasoning or hallucination. Addressing this gap requires moving
beyond traditional question-answering formats to develop scalable
methodologies that can directly probe for such intrinsic errors. Our
study proposes a novel framework to rigorously and automatically
evaluate intrinsic hallucination in financial tabular reasoning.
2.3 Automatic Dataset Construction
The high cost and limited scalability of manual annotation have
driven the development of automated evaluation dataset construc-
tion methods. Some approaches achieve fine-grained analysis by
decomposing generated content into atomic facts for verification
[1,7,13], while others leverage the inherent structure of rela-
tional data to automatically generate complex, verifiably question-
answer pairs [ 18]. Adversarial test cases can be dynamically created
through data perturbation [ 26]. Although using LLMs as annota-
tors may introduce biases [ 28], recent work shows that carefully
designed automated pipelines can yield high-quality annotations,
sometimes rivaling human performance [ 12]. We build on these
advancements by adapting and extending automated benchmarking
paradigms to the unique challenges of financial tabular analysis.
3 TASK DEFINITION
In this section, we focus on the core requirement of retrieving in-
formation from context and providing accurate answers in complex
financial scenarios, which is a common need for financial LLM
applications. We formulate the task as a context-aware masked
span prediction over tabular financial data, for the goal of intrinsic
hallucination evaluation. Figure 1 demonstrates key flow.
3.1 Problem Formulation
Let a financial document 𝐷be composed of a set of structured tables
Tand a body of text. This text is partitioned into two distinct, non-
overlapping sets:
•A set of explanatory pre-texts P, where each pre-text 𝑃𝑇∈P
introduces the table 𝑇∈T.
•A sequence of general sentences 𝑆=(𝑠1,𝑠2,...,𝑠 𝑁), which con-
stitutes the remaining text of the document.
Within a given sentence 𝑠𝑖∈𝑆, we identify a set of non-overlapping
spans of interest,M𝑖={𝑚𝑖,1,𝑚𝑖,2,...,𝑚 𝑖,𝑘}, based on specific cri-
teria. A task instance is constructed by selecting a single span
𝑚𝑖,𝑗∈M 𝑖and replacing its content with a [MASK] token, produc-
ing a corrupted sentence ˜𝑠𝑖.
The objective of the model 𝑓is to recover the original content of
the masked span 𝑚𝑖,𝑗. The model is conditioned on the corrupted
sentence and a context set 𝐶𝑖:
ˆ𝑚𝑖,𝑗=𝑓(˜𝑠𝑖,𝐶𝑖) (1)

goal is for the predicted span ˆ𝑚𝑖,𝑗to be matched with the original

3.2 Masking Criteria
To ensure the task setup yields meaningful and unbiased hallucina-
tion evaluation, three key assumptions must hold for each masked
span. These assumptions guide our masking strategy and directly
impact the reliability of evaluation outcomes:
•Uniqueness: The masked span must have a unique correct
answer, preventing multiple plausible completions.
–Example: A sentence like "The company’s [MASK] has im-
proved" would be excluded, as several financial metrics such
as "revenue," "profit margin," or "cash flow" could all be rea-
sonable answers.
•Consistency: The ground-truth span must be consistent with
the context, avoiding internal misalignments within the source
document.
–Example: If the table reports operating income as $500 million ,
the masked sentence should not mistakenly state "Operating
income was $500 thousand " as the to-be-masked truth. Evalu-
ating based on the incorrect masked content would unfairly
penalize a model that correctly aligns with the table.
•Answerability: The masked span must be inferable from the
provided context, ensuring the task is solvable by an LLM.
–Example: If the sentence states "The company’s revenue in-
creased by [MASK] in 2024 compared to 2023," both revenue
figures for 2024 and 2023 should be present in the tables or
described in the surrounding text; otherwise, the span is not
answerable and should be excluded from evaluation.
To enforce these assumptions and ensure reliable evaluation, we
adopt the following design:
(1)Numeric Span Selection: We restrict masking to numeric
spans that include units or verbal scales (e.g., "million," "USD"),
ensuring that the masked content is both specific and uniquely
recoverable. We also implement normalization strategies for
evaluation to account for equivalent numeric representations.Algorithm 1 Precision-Relaxed Matching with Unit Groups

⊲Check for set equality of unit groups
9:return𝑖𝑠_𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑐 _𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ,𝑖𝑠 _𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡_𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ
(2)Reliable Source Documents: We use company annual reports
(i.e., 10-K reports) as the data source, minimizing the likelihood
of contradictions due to their regulatory rigor and editorial
consistency.
(3)Answerability Annotation: We utilize LLMs to annotate the
answerability of the spans and conducted a comprehensive pilot
study by comparing human annotations with LLM-generated
annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can reliably support the
answerability labeling process.
3.3 Robust Evaluation
Our evaluation protocol is designed to robustly handle the nuances
of numerical text, ensuring that valid predictions are not penalized
due to formatting or semantic variations. We specifically account
for two potential sources of ambiguity where a simple string com-
parison would prove insufficient:
(1)Compromised Uniqueness: In certain contexts, a masked
span could be correctly expressed in multiple values, violating
the Uniqueness assumption. For instance, in "the company’s
revenue increased by [MASK], " both a percentage change ( "10%" )

=== Page 4 ===
Preprint, , Zhang, et al.
and an absolute value ( "$5 million" ) could be factually correct
based on the source table.
(2)Formatting Variations: A single numeric value can be written
in many equivalent string formats (e.g., $1,230 million vs.USD
1.23 billion ). A simple string match would incorrectly penalize
valid predictions.
To address the first challenge, we guide the model by incorporat-
ing a hint into the prompt that specifies the expected value type
(e.g., percentage or absolute value), thereby restoring uniqueness.
To solve the second, we introduce a precision-relaxed evaluation
protocol that normalizes and compares the numeric predictions.
This protocol is detailed in Algorithm 1 and consists of two main
components:
Numeric Matching. This process first normalizes the ground-
truth span𝑚and the predicted span ˆ𝑚into base values. It parses
numbers and scale indicators (e.g., “million,” “billion”) to derive
a base number 𝑣(e.g., “1.23 billion” becomes 1.23×109). It then
determines the numerical precision from the least significant digit.
For instance, the number 1,230,000 has a precision 𝑝of104, as its
last non-zero digit is in the ten thousands place. A numeric match
is declared if the ground-truth and predicted values are equal after
being rounded to the coarser of their two precisions.
Unit Matching. We define a set of unit groupsU, where each
group contains aliases for a single unit (e.g., {$, USD, dollars}, {mil,
million, M}). We extract the set of unit groups present in each span
by greedily matching the longest aliases first. For non-scale units,
matching is successful only if all groups found in 𝑚are present in
ˆ𝑚
3.4 Financial Reasoning Scenarios
To facilitate a fine-grained analysis of model performance, we cate-
gorize each masked span based on the complexity of the financial
reasoning required to restore its content. We define four distinct
scenarios:
A.Direct Lookup: The answer can be found by directly extracting
a single cell in a table.
B.Comparative Calculation: The answer requires a simple cal-
culation on a single metric across different time periods or
categories (e.g., computing a year-over-year change).
C.Bivariate Calculation: The answer involves a simple calcula-
tion between two distinct metrics explicitly present in the table
(e.g., computing a financial ratio).
D.Multivariate Calculation: The answer requires multi-step
reasoning over three or more metrics or a sequence of arithmetic
operations.
Recognizing that a masked span can sometimes be derived through
multiple valid reasoning paths, we do not let LLM determine a fixed
scenario label during answerability annotation step. Instead, dur-
ing evaluation time, we instruct each model to classify its own
reasoning process into one of the four scenarios. To establish a
reliable scenario classification for our analysis, we aggregate the
scenario classifications from all models that correctly predict the
span’s content. The final scenario for that span is the class with
highest frequency, ensuring our analysis is grounded in successful
and verifiable reasoning steps from LLM.Table 1: Agreement among LLMs and human annotation for

able" and "unanswerable" respectively. The LLMs used are

3.5 Pilot Study
To validate our evaluation dataset construction methodology, we
conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using LLMs for
annotation.
Manual Annotation. We begin by creating a ground-truth
dataset. We sample 1,124 text spans from the "Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis" section of 10-K reports from nine compa-
nies across diverse industries (e.g., healthcare, finance, technology).
Each span is labeled for answerability by at least two financial
experts, with a senior reviewer adjudicating disagreements. This
process yields a high inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss’ Kappa =
0.905) and results in 300 answerable and 824 unanswerable spans.
The annotators also classify the 300 answerable spans into our four
financial reasoning scenarios (A: Direct Lookup, B: Comparative,
C: Bivariate, D: Multivariate), resulting in a distribution of 212, 58,
22, and 8 respectively, which reflects the natural rarity of more
complex reasoning tasks.
LLM Annotation. We then prompt three leading LLMs (GPT-4.1,
Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-Pro) with the answerability annota-
tion task. The results, summarized in Table 1, show that unani-
mous LLM consensus is an exceptionally strong indicator of
answerability correctness . When all three models agreed, they
correctly identified 626 of 627 unanswerable spans (99.8% accuracy)
and 276 of 287 answerable spans (96.2% accuracy).
This pilot study validates that leveraging unanimous LLM con-
sensus is a highly reliable and scalable strategy for annotating
answerability. It is worth noting that we only mask existing text
rather than generating new content; thus, using LLMs as annota-
tors does not introduce fabrications. This ensures the soundness of
our approach for creating intrinsic hallucination evaluation bench-
marks.
4 EVALUATION DATASET
4.1 Data Collection and Processing
Our dataset is built upon publicly available 10-K reports from S&P
500 companies filed in 2024, ensuring the data reflects real-world
financial reporting practices and covers a wide spectrum of indus-
tries. We source these documents in XBRL format from the SEC’s

EDGAR database1. The collected filings then undergo several pro-
cessing steps to extract high-quality numerical claims and their
surrounding context.
Item 7 Extraction. From each 10-K filing, we extract "Item 7:
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" (MD&A). This section is selected for its rich
narrative analysis and manageable length, providing a dense source
of contextualized financial data. We apply a keyword-based search
to locate the MD&A section, supplementing this automated process
with manual curation to ensure data quality.
Context and Sentence Extraction. To avoid overlaps between
context and sentence, we first extract tables and their immediate
preceding sentence as the explanatory pre-texts. Then we parse the
rest of the content into plain text. After which a sentence split is
performed using spaCy to get a list of candidate sentences which
incorporated custom rules to merge fragments that typically arose
as artifacts from the document conversion process.
Numerical Span Identification. From this sentence corpus,
we isolate claims containing numerical data. This is a two-stage
process:
•Initial Detection: We employ spaCy’s Named Entity Recogni-
tion (NER) to detect entities such as MONEY, PERCENT, CAR-
DINAL, and QUANTITY.
•Span Expansion: To ensure the extracted spans are semanti-
cally complete, we expand the initial NER outputs with rules to
include relevant currency symbols (e.g., $) and a comprehensive
vocabulary of financial units and scales (e.g., "million," "billion,"
"per share").
LLM-based Answerability Annotation. To create a repre-
sentable sample, we randomly select 10 sentences from each 10-K
report. Following the same setting in pilot study, three popular
LLMs are employed for annotating whether each span is answer-
able given the provided context. A span is retained in the final
dataset only if all three models unanimously classified it as answer-
able.
4.2 Dataset Statistics
Table 2 presents a statistical overview of our dataset, which is com-
posed of a human-annotated Pilot Split and a larger, LLM-annotated
Main Split covering 453 S&P 500 companies after processing and
filtering.
A key characteristic of our dataset is its realistic complexity.
With an average context length exceeding 12,800 characters and
1https://www.sec.govan average of 19.2 tables per document, the dataset is designed to
mirror the information-dense nature of real-world financial reports.
This substantial context poses a significant challenge for LLMs, pro-
viding a robust testbed for evaluating their reasoning and retrieval
capabilities under practical, real-world conditions.
5 EXPERIMENTS
5.1 Experimental Setup
We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary
LLMs on our dataset’s pilot and main splits. During evaluation,
we prompt the models to generate a step-by-step rationale before
predicting the final masked value and to self-classify their reasoning
process into one of the four financial scenarios (A-D). The detailed
prompt is available in Appendix A.1.
Accuracy is used as the primary evaluation metric, computed
for overall predictions and separately for the numeric value and
unit components. In addition, we report the accuracy stratified by
financial scenario. For the pilot split, scenario labels are assigned
by human annotators. For the main split, we use the strategy stated
in section 3.4. This stratification allows for a detailed analysis of
error types.
All models are run with a temperature of 0 to ensure reproducibil-
ity. Proprietary models are accessed via their official APIs, while
open-source models are run on 4 H200 GPUs using the LLaMA-
Factory framework [ 29]. We implement a retry mechanism (up to
3 attempts) to handle instances where a model failed to produce a
valid JSON output.
5.2 Experiment Results
This section presents a detailed analysis of the performance of
various LLMs on our financial hallucination benchmark. The com-
prehensive results, detailed in Table 3, facilitate an objective as-
sessment of current model capabilities and limitations in finance.
Our findings reveal a clear stratification of model performance,
underscore the direct relationship between reasoning complexity
and hallucination risk, and identify dominant error patterns that
highlight specific model weaknesses.
5.2.1 A Quantifiable Hierarchy of Model Reliability. The results
demonstrate a distinct performance hierarchy among the evaluated
models.
A top tier of proprietary models, led by Claude-Sonnet-4 (95.6%
on Main Split) and Gemini-2.5-Pro (91.9% on Main Split), exhibits
high overall accuracy. Their strong performance, which remains
largely consistent between the Pilot and Main splits, validates the
robustness of our benchmark. However, the 4-8% error rate, while
low relative to other models, remains a significant consideration
for financial applications where precision is non-negotiable.
Below this top tier, we observe a second group of capable mod-
els, including GPT-4.1 (89.2%) and GPT-4.1-mini (88.2%), which
deliver respectable but demonstrably lower accuracy. A further
sharp decline is evident in the majority of other models, particu-
larly smaller open-source variants. Models such as Llama-3.1-8B
(47.5%) and Qwen-3-8B (30.6%) exhibit high error frequencies, ren-
dering them unsuitable for tasks requiring financial fidelity.

5.2.2 Reasoning Complexity as the Primary Performance Differ-
entiator. The analysis of performance across the four reasoning
scenarios (A-D) reveals that task complexity is the most significant
factor influencing model reliability.
Degradation in Multi-step Scenarios. While most models perform
adequately on Direct Lookup (A) , accuracy systematically de-
creases as tasks require calculation and logical inference. The most
pronounced performance drop occurs in the Multivariate Cal-
culation (D) scenario, which serves as a stress test for multi-step
reasoning. On this task, a significant number of models, including
several with relatively higer parameter counts (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B,
Mistral-small-24B), score at or near 0.0%. This indicates a funda-
mental breakdown in their ability to reason under complex context,
leading to the fabrication of outputs.
Resilience in Top-Tier Models. In contrast, the top-performing
models demonstrate notable, albeit imperfect, resilience on complex
tasks. Gemini-2.5-Pro is particularly robust in the Multivariate
Calculation (D) scenario, achieving 90.0% accuracy on the Main
Split. Claude-Sonnet-4 also performs strongly at 80.0%. While
these results are promising and highlight advanced reasoning ca-
pabilities, a 10-20% failure rate on the most complex calculations
represents a critical barrier. This difficulty in maintaining factual
consistency through multi-step logic remains a primary vector for
intrinsic hallucinations.
5.2.3 Case Study. Beyond aggregate metrics, we perform a quali-
tative analysis to diagnose the models’ specific failure modes. Our
analysis reveals several recurring patterns, with one of the most
significant being scale error. This occurs when a model correctly
identifies a numerical value but fails to associate it with the proper
magnitude (e.g., reporting "$150" instead of "$150 million"). Correct-
ing for this single error type in Llama-3.3-70B’s outputs, for instance,Table 4: Key financial attributes for Mohawk Commons used
in the masked value inference task. (Table headers and rows
have been truncated for clarity.)
Investment Ownership % Debt ($M) Rate Maturity
Gotham 49% $8.5 8.36% Mar 2024
Mohawk Commons 18.1% $7.2 5.80% Mar 2028
Total $188.8
would boost its value accuracy from 37.0% to 57.7%, highlighting
this as a critical vulnerability in contextual numerical grounding.
However, more profound failures stem from a deficient under-
standing of financial concepts that require multi-step reasoning
across different data sources. To illustrate these deeper challenges,
we now present a representative detailed case study on a sample
that required latent variable inference from both tabular and textual
context. The target span was the equity investment value ($20.2
million) in the following scenario:
On January 27, 2023, Fund V acquired a 90% interest
in an unconsolidated venture for $20.2 million , which
purchased a shopping center, Mohawk Commons, lo-
cated in Schenectady, New York, for $62.1 million, in-
clusive of transaction costs.
Table 4 contains the relevant details for Mohawk Commons,
including the 18.1% ownership and the pro-rata share of mortgage
debt ($7.2M).
Model Reasoning Patterns: Only Gemini-2.5-Pro accurately
inferred the masked value. Its reasoning chain involved several
inferential steps: The model first identified the relevant table entry
(Mohawk Commons) that matched the acquisition described in the
text. The model then inferred the total mortgage debt on the asset
by dividing the pro-rata debt ($7.2 M) by the ownership percentage

=== Page 7 ===
FAITH: A Framework for Assessing Intrinsic Tabular Hallucinations in Finance Preprint, ,
(18.1%), yielding $39.7 M. Subtracting this value from the purchase
price ($62.1 M) gave the total equity ($22.4 M), to which the model
applied the Fund’s 90% interest, ultimately arriving at the correct
equity investment value of $20.2 M.
In contrast, GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 failed to utilize the
debt information from the table. Instead, both models based their
prediction solely on the information in the sentence, by simply
calculating 90% of the purchase price ( 62.1M×0.90=55.9M). This
neglects the mortgage debt and indicates insufficient integration of
tabular data.
Implications for Multimodal Reasoning: This example re-
veals a key limitation in current LLM capabilities: the inference of
latent variables that require synthesizing information across modal-
ities and reasoning over implicit relationships. Only Gemini 2.5
Pro reconstructed the correct financial logic chain, whereas other
models defaulted to predicting the masked span without grounding
answers in the provided numerical data.
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we introduced a new dataset and a dynamic frame-
work for evaluating hallucinations of LLMs in the financial domain,
providing a nuanced view of their current capabilities. Our findings
indicate that even state-of-the-art models struggle with the nuances
of financial tabular data. While leading models are approaching
the accuracy required for less critical applications, the fundamen-
tal challenges of ensuring factual integrity, particularly regarding
numerical scale in complex reasoning, remain the primary barrier
to their safe deployment in accuracy-critical financial workflows.
For future work, we plan to expand the benchmarking datasets to
include more document types and more complex reasoning scenar-
ios. Another promising direction is to study how factors like table
size and the number of tables in the context affect hallucination
rates. In summary, we believe that robust, domain-specific evalua-
tion is a crucial step towards building more reliable and trustworthy
LLMs for financial applications.

A PROMPT TEMPLATES
A.1 Financial Span Answerability Annotation
You are given the following tables from a 10-K annual report:
{tables_with_pretext }
Filing date: { filing_date }
Sentence: { pre_sentence } {sentence } {post_sentence }
Your task:
For each highlighted span substring (shown as
<SPAN>{span}</SPAN> ) in the sentence, determine if the span is:
- unanswerable: Spans that
-do not represent some type of numeric financial data (e.g., phone
numbers, pincodes, or any other noise), or
-the span cannot be derived from or supported by the table by
any method.
- answerable: Spans that
- can be directly found in the table, or-can be derived through some calculations (such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, or division), or
-can be inferred via deeper reasoning involving multiple table
entries
Instructions:
(1) Carefully analyze every given table and the given sentence.
(2)For each <SPAN>{span}</SPAN> , in the sentence: - Label the span
as answerable or unanswerable
(3) Provide a concise explanation for your reasoning.
Output Format:
```json
{
"reasoning": <A detailed explanation for each highlighted
span in the sentence - if it is answerable: how it can
be matched, derived, or inferred from the table,
