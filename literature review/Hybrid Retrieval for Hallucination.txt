Abstract.
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language comprehension and genera-
tion but are prone to hallucinations, producing factually incorrect or unsupported
outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems mitigate this by ground-
ing LLM responses with external knowledge. This study evaluates the relationship
between retriever effectiveness and hallucination reduction in LLMs using three re-
trieval approaches: sparse retrieval (BM25-based keyword search), dense retrieval
(semantic search with Sentence Transformers), and the proposed hybrid retrieval
module which incorporates information from query expansion and further fuses the
results of sparse and dense retrievers through a dynamically-weighted Reciprocal
Rank Fusion (RRF) score. Using the HaluBench dataset, a benchmark for halluci-
nations in Question Answering tasks, we assess retrieval performance with MAP
and NDCG metrics, focusing on the relevance of the top-3 retrieved documents.
Results show that the hybrid retriever has a better relevance score outperforming
both sparse and dense retrievers. Further evaluation of LLM-generated answers
against ground truth using metrics like accuracy, hallucination rate, and rejection
rate reveals that the hybrid retriever achieves the highest accuracy on fails, the low-
est hallucination rate, and the lowest rejection rate. These findings highlight the
hybrid retriever’s ability to enhance retrieval relevance, reduce hallucination rates,
and improve LLM reliability, emphasizing the importance of advanced retrieval
techniques in mitigating hallucinations and improving response accuracy.

1. Introduction
Advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have brought large language mod-
els to the forefront, revolutionizing both academic research and practical applications in
diverse domains. RAG is an approach that enhances LLMs by integrating retrieval mech-
anisms to improve response accuracy and reduce hallucinations [1]. Instead of relying
solely on the model’s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant external documents

from a knowledge source (e.g., databases, search engines, or vector stores) and incorpo-
rates them into the generation process. By integrating retrieval mechanisms from exter-
nal sources, RAG effectively addresses major limitations of standalone LLMs [2, 3], in-
cluding the high costs associated with training and fine-tuning [4], the issue of hallucina-
tion [5–8], and constraints imposed by the input window [9] and knowledge cut-off [1].
Moreover, RAG has already become a foundational technology in various real-world
products like Contextual AI [14] and Cohere [15].
RAG system blends the encyclopedic memory of a search engine with the genera-
tive models and consists of two main modules as the retrieval phase (R) and the genera-
tion phase (G). In the retrieval phase, a retriever fetches relevant documents based on the
input query using three retrieval approaches: a sparse retriever leveraging ( BM25 [10]-
based lexical matching), a dense retriever(using embeddings from Sentence Transform-
ers), or a hybrid approach (combining both methods). These retrieval algorithms have
been inspired from Information Retrieval (IR), where search systems seek for alternative
retrieval approaches to satisfy the information need of users, i.e. retrieving the most rele-
vant documents at the top positions of a ranked list with respect to a given user query [11].
Many popular web search engines employ BM25 or similar ranking algorithms to deter-
mine the relevance of search results for a given query.
This paper explores the effectiveness of different retrieval methods in reducing hal-
lucinations. Note that hallucinations occur when the generated answers are not faithful
to the context (intrinsic hallucinations) or don’t align with factual reality (extrinsic hal-
lucinations) [12, 13]. In this paper, we focus solely on intrinsic hallucinations since in
real-world settings, user-provided documents may contain information that conflicts with
external knowledge sources.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the hybrid retrieval
performance in mitigating hallucinations. Our main contributions are as follows:
•We use a query expansion module to increase the coverage of the hybrid retrieval
phase.
•We evaluated how different types of retrieval performance affect hallucinations in
LLM generated outputs.
This paper is organized by introducing the motivation behind reducing hallucina-
tions in LLMs through Retrieval-Augmented Generation. The second section surveys re-
cent RAG studies, highlighting key retrieval strategies and their relevance to mitigating
hallucinations. In the third section, we detail our hybrid retrieval methodology, under-
scoring query expansion and dynamic weighting. The fourth section outlines the experi-
mental setup and results on the dataset, and the paper concludes with final observations
on the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid retriever followed by future work.
2. Related Work
RAG systems have emerged as a promising solution to the inherent limitations of LLMs,
particularly their tendency to hallucinate or generate inaccurate information [14, 15].
By integrating retrieval mechanisms, RAG systems retrieve relevant external knowledge
during the retrieval phase, which is then incorporated into the query. This ensures that the
LLM’s generated output is informed by up-to-date and contextually relevant information
[16].

=== Page 3 ===

Early work in [17] and [8] demonstrated that complementing LLMs with specialized
retrievers can substantially ground the generated text in factual evidence.This has spurred
research into a variety of domain-specific and application-specific RAG approaches, such
as [18, 19], where sophisticated modules decrease hallucinations by parsing industry ab-
breviations and consolidating context from heterogeneous sources.
Additionally, [20, 21] and [22, 23] illustrate both benchmark comparisons and
methodological guides for improving retrieval accuracy, with an emphasis on ensuring
that even black-box LLMs can trace back to reliable evidence like discussed in this pa-
per [24].
Recent research has focused on enhancing the efficiency and performance of RAG
systems by improving their retrieval components like discussed in this papers [25] and
[16, 26] highlight how fusing dense and sparse retrieval signals yields higher relevance
in challenging Q&A contexts [27].
This fusion approach is further explored in [28] and [29, 30], where rank fusion,
weighted scoring, and dynamic weighting strategies emerge as key factors for precise,
context-rich retrieval. Contributions such as [2, 3, 31, 32] and offer an analytical lens
through which prompt optimization, domain adaptation, and query expansion recom-
mender modules, most recent paper [22] demonstrate that by expanding the query to rel-
evant fields may enhance response quality by improving the relevance of the retrieved
information which can further reduce irrelevance or hallucinations.
Despite considerable progress in hybrid retrieval and RAG systems, gaps remain in
understanding how retrieval approaches dynamically adapt to specific query scenarios
and how these adaptations influence hallucination reduction. By extending the findings
of previous research, our study systematically investigates the role of hybrid retrieval
in mitigating hallucinations, ultimately paving the way for more reliable and accurate
outputs in large language models.
3. Methodology
In this section we describe our RAG system which is composed of two main modules as
the retrieval and the generation phase as mentioned in Section 1. In the retrieval phase,
differently from the studies in the literature, we incorporated a query expansion ( QE)
module on top of the hybrid retrieval. The goal of this step is to address lexical chasm , i.e.
the gap or the mismatch between the vocabulary used to formulate query and to represent
information in documents.
3.1.Retrieval Phase
The retrieval phase of a LLM-driven RAG system often contains two main components:
theindexed database and the retriever [2]. The indexed database DB is an external
knowledge-base which is a structured collection of documents di∈D, for i={1, ...,n}.
These documents include domain-specific knowledge, thus the relevant information with
respect to the potential user queries of the current use-case. The steps in the retrieval
phase are as follows. First, Dis stored offline in DB. Then, the retriever encodes qand all
Din a vector space. Following that the retriever applies a chosen similarity function fsim
which computes a similarity score between two given vector representations of qanddi

and ranks dibased on their relevance to a given query q. In this way, the most relevant di
with respect to qis supposed to get the highest score.
Various retrieval methods leverage different types of information from qandD.
Sparse retriever ( RetS) performs a keyword search through projecting qandDinto a
sparse vector space, usually employing traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) techniques like
BM25 [10] or t f∗id f. These BoW approches often struggle with synonyms and varying
contextual meanings and fails to capture the semantic relationships between the words.
To address these limitations, dense retrievers ( RetD) [33, 34] perform semantic
search by encoding qandDinto dense vectors to capture their semantic meaning.
On the other hand, hybrid approach leverages information both from sparse and
dense vector representations through combining their similarity (relevance) scores.
While the conventional approach for hybrid retriever typically uses a linear combination
of sparse and dense retriever scores, our hybrid retriever denoted as RetHyb−RRFutilizes
Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) [28,35] to establish the final ranking. In contrast to score-
based interpolation, RRF uses the ranking positions of each document retrieved by the
individual retrievers, providing a more balanced and effective fusion of results. Further-
more, rather than choosing a retriever among sparse, dense, or hybrid retrieval strategies,
our proposed retriever RetHyb−RRFcompares all these three strategies and adapts its be-
haviour based on the current query’s characteristics. Unlike many hybrid models that rely
on computationally intensive dense retrievers requiring complex compression techniques

such as linear projection, PCA, or product quantization [36], RetHyb−RRFenhances re-
trieval effectiveness by integrating a query expansion ( QE) module to increase the query
coverage and adapting the weights of different retrieval approaches with respect to the
query’s characteristics.
In this work, our aim is to systematically evaluate three retrieval approaches
sparse ,dense , and hybrid to measure their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.
The hybrid method integrates keyword and semantic searches through query expansion
and dynamic weighting as illustrated in Figure 1, aiming to maximize both precision and
recall [37] and further examine its influence on LLM generated responses as illustrated
in Figure 2
Hybrid retrieval approach Our hybrid retrieval process RetHyb−RRFstarts with QE,
an essential step aimed at enhancing the retrieval phase by augmenting qwith seman-
tically related terms. For this purpose, WordNet [38], a comprehensive lexical database
that demonstrates the relationships between words—such as synonyms (similar mean-
ings), antonyms (opposite meanings), or words within the same category—is utilized.
Let the original query qbe seen as the set of query terms qj, denoted as qj∈q, for
j={1, ...,|q|}where |q|is the number of terms in the query. In QE, for each qj, we
retrieve a set of synonym terms from WordNet via NLTK2and use only top−2 most-
relevant terms denoted as T(qj)to expand qnot to change its original intent. Then, the
expanded query q′is defined as:
q′=q∪T(qj) (1)
As an example, if qj=car, we can include T={automobile ,vehicle }from Word-
Net, to create q′. Then q′is utilized during RetHyb−RRFto close the lexical gap between q
anddi. Query expansion techniques have already been shown to enhance recall in infor-
mation retrieval tasks [39] through increasing query coverage. After the QE,RetHyb−RRF
employs dynamic weighting [40] to optimize the contributions of RetSandRetDbased on
the characteristics of q′. These characteristics are assessed by evaluating the term distri-
bution and level of informativeness of q′[41]. Specific queries that are detailed, focused,
and often seek precise information or exact matches are given greater weight to RetS,
whereas general queries that are broad or open-ended which lack specific details and
typically require a high-level or conceptual information, are weighted more to RetD[42].
LetwRetSandwRetDrepresent the weights assigned to RetSandRetD. These weights
are dynamically computed by RetHyb−RRFbased on a query specificity score [41, 43, 44]
denoted as S(q′):
S(q′) =1
|q′||q′|
∑
i=1t f∗id f(qj) (2)
Then, we assign the weights to retrievers wRetbased on the query specificity score
as follows:
2https://www.nltk.org/

=== Page 6 ===
January 2025
wRetS=αS(q′) (3)
wRetD=1−wRetS (4)
where αthat is set to 1 by default, serves as a scaling factor for normalization. For
specific queries with a high specificity score S(q′),wRetSwill be higher, whereas for gen-
eral queries with a low S(q′),wRetDwill be lower. This dynamic weighting mechanism
customizes the retrieval process based on the query’s characteristics, potentially enhanc-
ing both precision and recall.
Next, RetSandRetDindependently retrieve the top−k(k=3, in our case) docu-
ments denoted as DRetSandDRetDbased on their respective scoring mechanisms, BM25
forRetSusing exact lexical matches and cosine −similarity forRetDwhich aims to cap-
ture semantic similarity. For RetD, the vector embeddings of q′andDare both dense rep-
resentations created by the model sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v23[45]. Note
thatBM25 is particularly effective for specific queries, while cosine −similarity is more
effective for general queries. More details and the mathematical formula of BM25 can be
found in [46] and a detailed discussion on the use of sentence embeddings for semantic
search in [34].
After retrieving DRetSandDRetD, these two ranked lists are fused using a weighted
RRF score denoted as RRF weighted which is computed as follows:
RRF weighted (di) =∑
Ret∈{RetS,RetD}wRet
ε+rRet(di)(5)
where rRet(di)is the rank of diwhich exists in DRetSorDRetD, and wRetis the weight
assigned to the respective retriever during the dynamic weighting step of RetHyb−RRF,
andεis a small constant to avoid division by zero. RRF weighted (di)is the relevance score
then utilized by RetHyb−RRFto rank the documents diwith respect to a given query q. As
the final step, top−kdocuments with the highest RRF weighted (di)denoted as DRetHyb−RRF
are obtained by RetHyb−RRFas follows:
DRetHyb−RRF=argmax
diRRF weighted (di) (6)
Thus, diwhich are highly ranked by both RetSandRetDwill receive higher relevance
scores by RetHyb−RRF, while incorporating the previously assigned dynamic weights
wRetSandwRetD.DRetHyb−RRFis expected to provide the most relevant (precision) and the
broadest context (recall) for q, leveraging the advantages of both lexical ( RetS) and se-
mantic retrieval ( RetD) methods, where |DRetHyb−RRF|=3 (number of the retrieved docu-
ments by the hybrid retriever). This step ensures that the retrieval process not only iden-
tifies relevant documents but also ranks them in a way that maximizes their utility for
downstream tasks, such as answer generation in RAG systems.

3.2.Generation Phase
The generation phase consists of two key components: a prompt pand a chosen pre-
trained LLM M. In the retrieval phase, RetHyb−RRFretrieves the top−3 most-relevant
documents DRetHyb−RRFfrom DBbased on the query q′(expanded version of q) to incor-
porate context information into the query for the generation phase. For this, q′is concate-
nated with DRetHyb−RRFto form p(see Appendix A for the prompt we use) which is then
used as a prompt for Mto generate a response to the original query Q. We use standard
prompting with detailed instructions in zero-shot settings, i.e. without providing any ex-
emplars, although alternative approaches including few-shot learning [47] or Chain of
Thought (CoT) prompting [48], i.e. step-by-step reasoning, can be used in RAG systems
as demonstrated by [49].
Note that we use the pre-trained LLM without any fine-tuning, i.e changing the
model weights. The model used for the response generation is LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
[4], is a cutting-edge large language model with 8 billion parameters, max new tokens
= 8132, temperature=0.8, top p=0.9 optimized for instruction-following tasks.
4. Experimental Setup
In this section, we outline the experimental setup based on the proposed RAG pipeline,
as detailed in Section 3. To evaluate if the proposed pipeline is a promising approach on
mitigating hallucinations, we separately assess retrieval performance (Section 3.1) and
the overall effectiveness of the RAG pipeline by examining both the retrieval phase out-
put and the final response to the query q, which integrates the results of the retrieval and
generation phases (Section 3.2). This approach enables us to assess how retrieval perfor-
mance impacts the overall effectiveness of the pipeline in mitigating hallucinations.
4.1. Dataset
We conduct our study on the HaluBench dataset [50], a comprehensive hallucina-
tion evaluation benchmark consisting of 13,867 samples. The dataset is a combina-
tion of six diverse benchmarks that are source datasets, i.e. DROP [51], HaluEval [52],
RAGTruth [53], FinanceBench [54], PubMedQA [55], and COVIDQA [56], and contains
hallucinated and faithful responses to questions that may span various domains, includ-
ing general knowledge, reasoning, specific facts, or specialized topics including finance
and healthcare. The HaluBench dataset includes examples of challenging-to-detect hallu-
cinations, meaning instances that seem plausible but are not faithful to the context. Each
data instance in HaluBench includes a context passage ( di), a question based on that con-
text ( qdi), an LLM-generated answer, and a binary label indicating whether the answer
constitutes a hallucination in relation to the context ( PASS for correct answers and FAIL
for hallucinated answers). The binary labels in HaluBench were generated by comparing
the LLM-generated answer with the ground truth from the source dataset. Therefore, for
our evaluations, if an instance is labeled as PASS , its LLM-generated answer was consid-
ered the ground truth. However, for instances labeled as FAIL , the ground truth answer
was directly obtained from the corresponding source dataset.
For the evaluations, we utilized the different versions of HaluBench to separately
assess the retrieval phase and the overall effectiveness of the RAG pipeline in reducing

=== Page 8 ===

hallucinations. To evaluate the retrieval performance, we employed the entire HaluBench
dataset, which contains 13,867 instances denoted as HaluBench orig. In this dataset, we
measured the performance of the retrievers in an automated manner by using the ques-
tions q, and the respective context passages qdi. If a given retriever retrieves the con-
text passages qdifor a given q, then these retrieved documents are relevant , otherwise
irrelevant . On the other hand, for assessing the overall performance in mitigating hal-
lucinations, the evaluation cannot be fulfilled in an automated manner since the evalu-
ation requires reasoning capabilities and should be done by a human annotator which
is the standard approach [50]. Thus, we could not annotate the entire dataset and used
a randomly sampled subset of 300 instances which is denoted as HaluBench small, with
50 instances from each of the six source datasets to maintain dataset diversity. This sub-
set contained an equal number of PASS andFAIL instances per source dataset, with 25
instances of each, ensuring a balanced evaluation.
The responses of the entire RAG pipeline for all the queries Qin the annotated
dataset were labelled by a human annotator through comparing the generated response
and the ground truth answer with the following three labels:
•Hallucinated Answer ( ✗): The generated answer is factually incorrect or unsup-
ported by the provided context.
•Correct Answer ( ✓): The generated answer matches the ground truth and is factu-
ally accurate.
•Insufficient Context ( ?): The retrieved context does not provide sufficient infor-
mation to answer the query.
For the comparative evaluation, the responses from all three RAG pipelines, which
differ in their retrieval approaches (sparse, dense, and hybrid), were fully annotated.
The annotated files can be found in our github repo4Note that HaluBench small was
annotated by a single human annotator due to time constraints. Nonetheless, the query
set we annotated was not difficult so we believe that it was less prone to disagreements.
10 samples from the annotated dataset can be found in the Appendix.
4.2. Evaluation Metrics
Retrieval Metrics To evaluate the retrieval performance of our hybrid approach
RetHyb−RRF, we compared its performance with the sparse RetS, and dense RetDretriev-
ers. For this, we used commonly-used order-aware metrics from the Information Re-
trieval (IR) domain, namely Mean Average Precision (MAP) [20,57,58] and Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [11, 20, 59].
As mentioned in Section 3, since each retriever returns a ranked list of three docu-
ments ( top−3), these metrics were computed at a cut-off value, k=3, i.e. number of
documents considered for the evaluation.
MAP averages the precision @kmetric at each relevant item position in the retrieved
ranked list of documents, where precision @kmeasures the proportion of relevant doc-
uments in a ranked list of size k. For a query q, the Average Precision (AP) is defined
as:

=== Page 9 ===
January 2025
AP=1
|Rel q|n
∑
i=1Precision @i·⊮[reli=1] (7)
where ⊮[·]is the indicator function that specifies whether the document at rank iis
relevant and |Relq|is the total number of relevant documents for query q. The MAP of a
retriever is then computed as the mean of AP across the set of all queries Qin the dataset
as follows:
MAP =1
|Q|∑
q∈QAP(q) (8)
This metric rewards the retrieval approaches that put more relevant documents at
the top of the ranked list. DCG has a stronger concept of ranking which discounts the
“value” of each relevant document based on its rank in a ranked list of size kusing a
logarithmic discount function as follows:
DCG @k=k
∑
i=12reli−1
log2(i+1)(9)
NDCG @k=DCG @k
IDCG @k(10)
where reliis the relevance grade of a document at rank iand for the binary case, if a
document is relevant, relevance grade is assigned as 1, otherwise 0. NDCG@k then nor-
malizes DCG@k by the “ideal” ranked list (IDCG@k), where every relevant document
is ranked at the start of the list. For both MAP and NDCG metrics, higher scores mean
better retrieval performance.
Overall Evaluation Metrics To evaluate the overall performance of the RAG pipeline
in mitigating hallucinations, we utilize the following metrics as defined in [3, 58]:
• Accuracy: [30, 52] The proportion of correct answers among all generated an-
swers (higher values are better).
• Hallucination Rate: [60] The proportion of hallucinated answers among all gen-
erated answers (lower values are better).
• Rejection Rate: [3, 58] The proportion of cases where the retrieved context was
insufficient to answer the query (lower values are better).
• Adjusted Accuracy: [61–63] The proportion of correct predictions among all
cases where the model made a prediction, excluding cases with insufficient con-
text. It ensures that the metric focuses only on cases where the model attempts
to answer, providing a more precise evaluation of its performance. This metric is
defined as:
Adjusted Accuracy =Correct Answers
Correct Answers +Hallucinated Answers×100 (11)

4.3. Results
Retrieval Performance The evaluation results on HaluBench origof the three retriev-
ers, sparse, dense, and hybrid based on two metrics MAP@3 and NDCG@3 are dis-
played in Table 1. Regarding the MAP metric, RetSgives a score of 0 .724, RetDhas
0.768, while RetHyb−RRFachieves 0 .897. Similarly, for the NDCG, RetSandRetDget
0.732 and 0 .783 respectively, whereas RetHyb−RRFhas a relatively higher score of 0 .915.
The results indicate that hybrid retriever outperforms both the sparse and dense retrievers
across both retrieval metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining lexical and
semantic retrieval techniques. The performance gap between the retrievers in terms of
NDCG is larger due to its sensitivity to ranking. The enhancements in NDCG and MAP
can be attributed to the hybrid retriever’s capability to capture both exact matches and
semantic relevance, along with its utilization of query expansion and dynamic weighting.

This involves a comparative evaluation of three RAG pipelines with different retrieval
approaches ( RetS,RetD, and RetHyb−RRF), allowing us to examine the performance of dif-
ferent retrieval methods in mitigating hallucinations. In other words, this evaluation pro-
vides insights into whether they provide relevant and sufficient context for the next step
in the RAG pipeline, the generation phase (Section 3.2), which aims to generate accurate

responses by prompting the model M. The overall evaluation results on HaluBench small
are displayed in Figure 3.
The results show that the complete RAG pipeline using RetHyb−RRFas the retriever
outperformed the other two pipelines, which use RetSandRetDretrievers, across all
four evaluation metrics. Following the overall evaluation on the annotated HaluBench
dataset, we also assessed the performance of the RAG pipeline with RetHyb−RRFsepa-
rately across six source datasets from various domains. Based on accuracy, RetHyb−RRF
showed the best performance on the HaluEval and PubMed datasets with the accuracy
score of 92.00, while the worst performance on the FinanceBench (the accuracy score of
62.90). In terms of hallucination rate (lower is better), RetHyb−RRFachieved the lowest
score of 4.00 on the RAGTruth and PubMed datasets, whereas the highest score of 22.00
on the CovidQA. Regarding the rejection rate (lower is better), although RetHyb−RRFhad
the best performance on the HaluEval with the rejection rate of 2.00, the results on the
other datasets except the FinanceBench are similar. RetHyb−RRFgot the highest rejection
rate of 32.00 on the FinanceBench. Based on adjusted accuracy, RetHyb−RRFachieved
the highest score on the PubMed, while the lowest on the CovidQA. The findings re-
veal that although RetHyb−RRFexhibited the poorest performance on each metric for the
CovidQA and FinanceBench datasets which are domain-specific challenging datasets, it
significantly enhanced the results on these datasets with respect to other two retrievers.
Then, we also evaluated the performance of the pipeline with RetHyb−RRFonly on
the hallucinated samples (labelled as FAIL in the annotated dataset). There were 125
hallucinated samples in total. RAGTruth dataset does not contain any samples labelled
asFAIL . For this, we used the same three metrics from Section 4.2 as accuracy, hallu-
cination rate and rejection rate which were computed only on the 125 hallucinated ex-
amples. The overall evaluation results on these 125 hallucinated samples are displayed
in Figure 4, where the RAG pipeline with the RetHyb−RRFoutperformed others. And the
detailed evaluation results of hallucinated samples on each dataset are displayed in Ap-

pendix D. We have also evaluated our hybrid RAG pipeline by comparing it with the
baseline LLM(Llama-3-instruct-8B) model, the results are illustrated in Appendix B.
The results emphasize the importance of high-quality retrieval in minimizing hallucina-
tions in RAG systems. The hybrid retriever, combining lexical and semantic methods,
provided more relevant context, improving answer generation and reducing hallucination
rates.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we presented a hybrid retrieval approach RetHyb−RRF, designed to mitigate
hallucinations in LLMs by leveraging both sparse and dense retrievers. Experimental re-
sults on the HaluBench dataset demonstrated that hybrid retriever, which combines key-
word search and semantic search methods with query expansion and dynamic weighting,
consistently outperformed the other two sparse and dense retrieval methods in terms of
MAP@3 and NDCG@3. Moreover, the hybrid retriever reduced hallucination rates and
improved retrieval precision across domain-specific datasets, most notably in medical
and financial domains which are considered as more challenging. By providing more
relevant contextual documents, the hybrid strategy enabled higher accuracy in LLM-
generated answers and fewer instances of insufficient context. These findings highlight
the value of integrating hybrid retrieval methods for better robustness and reliability.
Future work may further explore optimizations, including incorporating advanced
re-ranking algorithms to further refine the selection of retrieved documents and by adapt-
ing our method to various data sets which are domain-specific. We also investigate the
impact of the proposed method on other types of LLMs, to evaluate its broader applica-
bility and effectiveness.

Dataset Example
HaluEval Context : 750 Seventh Avenue is a 615 ft (187m) tall Class-A office skyscraper in New
York City. 101 Park Avenue is a 629 ft tall skyscraper in New York City, New York.
Question : 750 7th Avenue and 101 Park Avenue, are located in which city?
Answer : 750 7th Avenue and 101 Park Avenue are located in Albany, New York.
DROP Context : Hoping to rebound from the road loss to the Chargers, the Rams went home for
Week 9, as they fought the Kansas City Chiefs in a Show Me State Showdown: The Chiefs
struck first as RB Larry Johnson got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period.
In the second quarter, things got worse for the Rams as QB Damon Huard completed
a 3-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, while kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 42-yard
field goal. St. Louis got on the board with RB Steven Jackson getting a 2-yard TD run,
yet Huard and Gonzalez hooked up with each other again on a 25-yard TD strike. Rams
kicker Jeff Wilkins made a 41-yard field goal to end the half. In the third quarter, QB
Marc Bulger completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis for the only score of the
period, yet the only score of the fourth quarter came from Huard completing an 11-yard
TD pass to TE Kris Wilson. With the loss, the Rams fell to 4-4.
Question : Which team scored the longest field goal kick of the game?
Answer : Rams
CovidQA Context : ......An important part of CDC’s role during a public health emergency is to
develop a test for the pathogen and equip state and local public health labs with testing
capacity. CDC developed an rRT-PCR test to diagnose COVID-19. As of the evening of
March 17, 89 state and local public health labs in 50 states......
Question : What kind of test can diagnose COVID-19?
Answer : rRT-PCR test
FinanceBench Context : Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years
ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions ex-
cept per share amounts) 2018 2017 2016 Net Revenue $ 64,661......
Question : What is the FY2018 fixed asset turnover ratio for PepsiCo? Fixed asset turnover
ratio is defined as: FY2018 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018).
Round your answer to two decimal places.
Answer : 3.7%
PubmedQA Context : ......The study cohort consisted of 1,797 subjects (1,091 whites and 706 blacks;
age = 21-48 years) enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study since childhood. BP variability
was depicted as s.d. of 4-8 serial measurements in childhood......
Question : Is adult hypertension associated with blood pressure variability in childhood
in blacks and whites : the bogalusa heart study?
Answer : No. Increases in BP variations as well as levels in early life are not predictive of
adult hypertension, which suggests that childhood BP variability does not have a signifi-
cant impact on the natural history of essential hypertension.
