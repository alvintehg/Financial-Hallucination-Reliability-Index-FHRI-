## Study Protocol

### Pre-Study Briefing (2 minutes)

Provide participants with the following information:

> **Welcome!** You will be testing a financial chatbot that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer investment-related questions. The system includes:
> - **Hallucination Detection**: Flags uncertain or potentially incorrect answers
> - **Contradiction Detection**: Warns when answers contradict previous responses
> - **Confidence Indicators**: Shows how confident the system is in its answers
>
> Your task is to interact with the chatbot naturally, ask financial questions, and provide feedback on your experience.

### Task Scenarios (10 minutes)

Ask participants to complete the following tasks using the chatbot:

#### Scenario 1: Company Performance Query
- **Task:** "Ask about Apple's recent quarterly performance"
- **Observe:** Does the user notice confidence scores? Do they trust the answer?

#### Scenario 2: Comparative Analysis
- **Task:** "Compare Microsoft and Apple's Q3 2024 performance"
- **Observe:** Does the user find the comparison helpful? Any hallucination flags?

#### Scenario 3: Financial Concept Explanation
- **Task:** "Ask what portfolio diversification means"
- **Observe:** Is the explanation clear? Does the user trust the definition?

#### Scenario 4: Follow-up Question (Contradiction Test)
- **Task:** "Ask a follow-up question that might contradict the previous answer"
- **Example:** "What about the energy sector performance?" (after asking about S&P 500)
- **Observe:** Does contradiction detection work? Is it helpful?

#### Scenario 5: Out-of-Knowledge Query
- **Task:** "Ask about something the system might not know"
- **Example:** "What was Tesla's stock price yesterday?"
- **Observe:** Does the system admit lack of knowledge? Hallucination detection?

2. **Usability Score:** Average of Q8-Q12 (Part C)
3. **Feature Usefulness:** Q16 scores
4. **Comparative Trust:** Q17 scores

## Sample Size Justification

**Target:** 5-10 participants

**Rationale:**
- For qualitative usability studies, 5 users can identify ~85% of usability issues (Nielsen Norman Group)
- For preliminary trust evaluation, 8-10 participants provide sufficient insights for FYP-level research
- Larger studies (n>30) are ideal for publication but not required for undergraduate projects
