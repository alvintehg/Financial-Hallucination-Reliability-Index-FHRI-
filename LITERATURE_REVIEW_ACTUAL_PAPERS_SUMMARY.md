## Tips for Writing

1. **Start with Section 2.2** (Hallucination Detection) - This is the most critical section
2. **Use the outline as a guide** - Don't just summarize papers, synthesize them
3. **Build a narrative** - Each section should lead to the next
4. **Focus on the gap** - Section 2.10 is crucial - it must clearly show why FHRI is needed
5. **Cite recent work** - Include at least 3-4 papers from 2024-2025
6. **Connect to your work** - Subtly hint at how FHRI addresses limitations (but don't describe FHRI yet - that's Chapter 3)
7. **ONLY use papers from folder** - Don't cite papers that aren't in the 63-paper list
