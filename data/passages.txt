Portfolio diversification is a risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher returns and pose a lower risk than any individual investment found within the portfolio.

The S&P 500 index returned 4.2% in Q3 2024, driven primarily by technology sector gains. Market volatility remained elevated due to interest rate concerns. Energy and healthcare sectors underperformed with returns of 1.8% and 2.1% respectively.

Risk-adjusted returns measure investment performance relative to the amount of risk taken. The Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, and Jensen's alpha are common metrics. A portfolio that returns 12.3% with moderate volatility typically outperforms a 9.8% return with similar risk characteristics on a risk-adjusted basis.

Goldman Sachs analysis indicates that actively managed portfolios with strong Q3 performance (12%+ returns) tend to carry higher concentration risk. Diversification across sectors, geographies, and asset classes remains crucial for sustainable long-term performance.

Quarterly portfolio rebalancing helps maintain target asset allocations. Research shows that portfolios rebalanced quarterly tend to have 0.5-1.0% better risk-adjusted returns compared to buy-and-hold strategies over 5-year periods.
