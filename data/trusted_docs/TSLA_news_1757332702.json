  "headline": "Elon Musk's New Tesla Pay Package: Why a Trillion Dollars Is No Joke",
  "summary": "A proposed pay package worth up to $1 trillion for Tesla’s gag-loving boss is totally serious, but it almost sounds like Dr. Evil’s nuclear blackmail demand for $100 billion in “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.” Unable to stop laughing, the president tells him it’s more than all the money in the world in 1969.
