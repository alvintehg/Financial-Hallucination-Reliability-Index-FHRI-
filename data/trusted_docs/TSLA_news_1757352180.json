  "summary": "Tesla  stock rose early Monday—a sign that cars simply don’t matter as much for the company as CEO Elon Musk and his artificial-intelligence ambitions—before slipping lower.  The moves come after Friday’s 3.6% gain, catalyzed by Tesla’s 2025 proxy statement that outlined a new pay package for Musk worth roughly $1 trillion if all performance incentives were met.  Tesla would also need to deliver 20 million vehicles, achieve 10 million active Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscriptions, deliver one million Optimus humanoid robots, and have one million robo-taxis in commercial operation.",
