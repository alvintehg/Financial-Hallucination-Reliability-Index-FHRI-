Abstract—Robo-Advisors has been growing attraction from 
the financial industry for offering financial services by using 
algorithms and acting as like human advisors to support investors making investment decisions. During the investment 
planning stage, portfolio optimization plays a crucial role, 
especially for the medium and long-term investors, in 
determining the allocation weight of assets to achieve the 
balance between investors expectation return and risk tolerance. The literature on the topic of portfolio optimization has been offering plenty of theoretical and practical guidance 
for implementing the theory; however, there is a paucity of 
studies focusing on the applications which are designed for Robo-Advisors. In this research, we proposed a modular system and focused on integrating big data analysis, deep 
learning method and the Black-Litterman model to generate 
asset allocation weight. We developed a portfolio optimization module which takes the information from a variety of sources, such as stocks prices, investor profile and the other alternative 
data, and used them as input to calculate optimal weights of 
assets in the portfolio. The module we developed could be used as a sub-system for Robo-Advisors, which offers a customized
optimal portfolio based on investors preference.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Financial technology (Fintech) has gotten a lot of traction 
from the financial institutions and start-ups since recent years. World Economic Forum in 2015 identified financial technology as a disruptive innovation which will reshape the future of the financial industry and make a significant impact on the functions of financial services, which including payment, insurance, deposits and lending, capital raising, and investment management. As an innovation in investment management sector, robo-advisors is the digital platform of financial service that provides automated investment management services to investors by using algorithms and 
acting as like human advisors to support investors making 
investment decisions. During the investment planning stage, portfolio optimization plays a crucial role, especially for the medium and long-
term investors, in determining the 
allocation weight of assets to achieve the balance between investors expectation return and risk tolerance. The literature on the topic of portfolio optimization has been offering plenty of theoretical and practical guidance for implementing the theory; however, there is a paucity of studies focusing on the applications which are designed for Robo-Advisors. To 
fill this research gap, this research aims to develop the 
system framework for robo-advisor which provides portfolio optimization to support investors during the process of making investment decisions. We proposed a modular 
system and focused on integrating big data analysis, deep 
learning method and the Black-Litterman model to generate 
asset allocation weight. We developed a portfolio optimization module which takes the information from a 
variety of sources, such as stocks prices, investor profile and 
the other alternative data, and used them as input to calculate 
optimal weights of assets in the portfolio. The module we developed could be used as a sub-system for Robo-Advisors, which offers investors an optimal portfolio based on their preference and expectations.

ELATED WORK S
A. Robo-Advisors
Robo-advisors is a digital platform which provides 
investment advisory and financial services for investors by using algorithms with the characteristics of low costs, availability, and ease-of-use. Traditional wealth management is both expensive and exclusive. Automated investment 
management in the form of robo-advisors seeks to change 
this and brings
wealth management to an affordable price
[1]. Robo-advisors is a disruptive innovation in financial 
services driven by big data [1, 2]. By applying big data and artificial intelligence, it has changed the way of providing wealth management services and forcing traditional advisory to evolve new business model [2, 3].
Robo-advisors make dynamic adjustments and asset 
allocation to form an optimal portfolio base on the given conditions and financial market status [2]. By collecting 
customers data and conducting customer segment, robo -
advisors allocate funds into assets and re-balance the portfolio based on algorithms, and preparing a report for investors to review their investment performance. The algorithm used by robo-advisors is based on data science and statistical model, following the changing financial market 
condition, which seeking an optimal portfolio to fit the 
client’s preference and expectation .
B. Deep Learning
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning method in 
artificial intelligence research field. Composing of multiple 
processing layers, deep learning allows computational 
models to extract higher levels of abstraction. In recent years, deep artificial neural networks have proved itself by its success in pattern recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing [4]. Aside from the application 
of picture recognition, the sequence to sequence translation is 
also a trending topic. Most of the former are done with 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Ne tworks Anal ysis and Minin g (ASONAM )

convolutional neural networks, and most of the latter is done 
with recurrent neural networks, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
C. Long Short-Term Memories for Time Series Forecasting
LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network used in deep 
learning, has the unique structure enables the model to make a prediction with earlier memories. It has gates to help it decides which information to remember, ignore, forget and select when new information flows in. LSTM can be not only applying on the sequence to sequence translation but 
also on financial prediction problems, such as pricing 
securities, constructing portfolio and risk management. Financial prediction problems involve large data sets with complex data interactions that are difficult to specify in standard methods in finance. It may detect these interactions in the data and produce a useful result. Literature [5] also stated that time-series problem could be solved by deep learning approach and unsupervised feature learning. Time 
series prediction problems are a difficult because of the 
complexity of a sequence dependence among the input 
variables added by time series. LSTM can handle these sort 
of sequence dependences because large architectures can be successfully trained. In addition, it has several advantages, such as expands and includes all possible relevance items to the input data, captures non-linearities and complex interactions among input data more easily to avoid over-fitting and increase in-sample f it versus traditional models.
D. The Black-Litterman Model
The Black-Litterman model [6-10] was developed by 
Fischer Black and Robert Litterman in 1992 at Goldman 
Sachs. It solved the issue of input sensitive when using the 
Markowitz Mean-Variance model [11]. The Black-Litterman model allows the investors to combine their views about 
certain assets with the market equilibrium returns to 
formulate the posterior expected return. This model has been widely accepted by the Wall Street mainstream for asset allocation.

METHODOLOGY
In this research, the System Development Research 
Methodology in information systems research [12] wasimplemented as our method. 
A. Research Design 
The development has divided into five stages for our 
robo-advisor system which is shown as follows:
1) Construct a Conceptual Framework: Describe and 
analyze the research problems for building a robo-advisor. 
Next, we investigate system requirement and functions, understand the system process and procedure, and survey system criteria and methods.
2) Develop a System Architecture: Develop a 
modularizable and expandable system architecture. Define 
the core functions of the system and describe the 
relationship between each function.
3) Analyze & Design the System: Design and implement 
the database and knowledge base for the robo-advisor 
system and evaluate the potential solutions.4) Build the System: Build the robo-advisor system and 
explore the solutions by progressively understanding the difficulties and complexity while implementing the system.
5) Observe & Evaluate the System: Observe and 
evaluate the performance of the robo-advisor system. Improve the system based on the experiences learned from the result of experiments.
Fig. 1. System Architecture
B. System Architecture
To perform the task of building a customized optimal 
portfolio, the system is composing by several modules written in Python language (shown in figure1). The modules in our system include: 
1) Data Collection Module 
It executes automated data collecting, extracting the daily 
adjusted closing price, encoding the data into a structured dataset, and saving the file with a unique serial number into a database for future access and retrieval.
2) Data Preprocessing Module 
It converts and transforms the time series data into a 
dataset for supervised learning. It calculates the logarithm return at each time point, and reshape the data into arrays that can be processed in the LSTM module. Each array contains a specified number of lag periods, the past n-days 
returns of adjusted closing prices, as input variables; and a 
specified number of predict period, the next n-days returns of adjusted closing prices, as the target variable.
3) LSTM Training Module 
It performs the function of training the model to capture 
the long-term tendencies and pattern for making forecasts. It processes the input data and compares its forecasts with the given true values. It will pass the weight to next epoch after each training epochs. It returns the training history and 
trained model as outputs. 
4) Forecasting Module 
This module is specially designed to make forecasting 
with a batch size of 1 to manually solve the error occurring 
when using the Stateful LSTM. This module uses the model trained by LSTM module to make a forecast and converts the forecast values into the formats that can be used in the various form of applications. 
5) Data Visualization Module 
It visualizes the data, including records of training loss, 
validation loss, training RMSE (root mean square errors) and 
test RMSE, plots figures of logarithm return fluctuations and 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Ne tworks Anal ysis and Minin g (ASONAM )

price movements, cumulative returns, and confusion matrix 
for portfolios and ETF components.
6) Portfolio Optimization Module 
In this module, we perform the portfolio optimization. It 
generates investor views about assets by using the result obtained from LSTM forecasting module. It calculates the historical mean and covariance, the posterior mean and covariance, and optimal portfolio weights.
C. Subjects and Data Collection
The daily adjusted closing price of ETFs (Exchange 
Traded Funds) is chosen as our input and target variable. 
ETF is marketable security that tracks an index, bonds, 
commodities, or a basket of assets. The benefits of trading ETFs is that it has higher liquidity and lower trading fees comparing with standard mutual funds. 
Our data collecting period is 10 years long from 
2007/01/03 to 2016/12/30, totally 2518 trading days. 322 
ETFs were collected and covere d 44 categories of assets 
(shown in table 1). All of them were incepted before 2007 and still circulating in the U.S. market after 2016. The data was automatically collected by our data collecting module used the data source providing by
Yahoo Finance.
D. The Black-Litterman Formula
We used the Black-Litterman model and Markowitz 
Mean-Variance Optimization to perform the portfolio optimization. The formula for the new Combined Return Vector (E[R]) is
E[R] =
Π + P'
 Q]
where
xE[R] i s the new (posterior) combined r eturn Vector 
(N x 1 column vector); 
xτ is a scalar; Σ is the covariance matrix of excess 
returns (N x N matrix); 
xP is a matrix that identifies the assets involved in 
the views (K x N matrix or 1 x N row vector in the special case of 1 view); 
xΩ is a diagonal covariance matrix of error terms 
from the expressed views representing the uncertainty in each view (K x K matrix); 
xΠ is the i mplied equilibrium return vector (N x 1 
column vector); and, 
xQ is the view vector (K x 1 column vector).
E. Steps to implement the Black-Litterman Model
To implement the Black-Litterman Model, the process 
can be divided into following steps:
1) Calculate historical mean and covariance.
2) Use historical mean as a priori implied equilibrium 
return.
3) Combine the investor views.
4) Calculate the posterior mean and covariance.5) Calculate the portfolio weight through the mean-
variance optimization using posterior mean and covariance.
IV. R ESULTS
In this section, we implemented the Black-Litterman 
model to perform portfolio optimization by integrating with the investor views generated by the LSTM forecasting module as an input for the Black-Litterman model. Six assets were chosen to construct our portfolio (shown in Table
I). To 
show the process of portfolio optimization, we considered a scenario that requires a fund manager to rebalance the portfolio weights at the beginning of each quarter (date is shown in Table II) to reach a higher cumulative return compared with the S&P 500 as a benchmark in 2016. This requires using our LSTM forecasting module to generate the investor views about the performance of chosen assets in each quarter.

A. The LSTM Based Investor Views 
We first prepared the investor views by usi ng the LSTM 
model to predict the quarterly returns for each quarter. Weused the past 120 daily returns as training data and forecasts 
the daily return for the next 60 trading days, which is exactly a quarter long. With the characteristics of the logarithmreturns, we can simply obtain the quarterly returns by adding up the forecasted daily returns for next 60 days from the outputs of our LSTM forecasting module. With the predictions of returns and prices for each asset at the end of 
each quarter (shown in Table III), we can then formulate our
investor views of each quarter (shown in table IV).

B. The Black-Litterman Model
Following the steps to implement the Black-Litterman 
model, we prepared the quarterly historical data, including historical average returns and the covariance matrix (shown in table V and VI) for each asset in our portfolio as the input for the Black-Litterman model. Next, we combined the investor views with the historical returns using the Black
-
Litterman formula to generate the posterior mean and posterior covariance matrix. And finally, using the same technique developed by Markowitz, we put the posterior mean and posterior covariance matrix back to the mean-variance optimization to obtain the portfolio weights. In 
Table VII, it presented the Black-Litterman portfolio 
weights, which were generated by cooperating with the LSTM investor views, and the Markowitz portfolio weights.

V. C ONCLUSION
We proposed a modular system and focused on 
integrating big data analysis, deep learning method and the 
Black-Litterman model to generate asset allocation weight. We developed a portfolio optimization module which takes the information from a variety of sources, such as stocks prices, investor profile and the other alternative data, thenused them as input to calculate optimal weights of assets in the portfolio. For the practitioner implications, the module 
we developed could be used as a sub -system for Robo-
Advisors, which offers investors a customized optimal portfolio based on their preference and the goal of the financial plan.
