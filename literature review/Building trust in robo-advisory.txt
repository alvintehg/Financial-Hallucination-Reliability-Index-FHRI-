Abstract
Purpose –This study sits at the intersection of ﬁnancial planning and FinTech, focusing on robo-advisory, an
affordable and accessible digital ﬁnancial advisory service. Individuals ’lack of trust has resulted in low
adoption of robo-advice. This study aims to understand the psychological process of how individuals build
trust in robo-advice, helping them engage with it more effectively and access affordable ﬁnancial advice.
Design/methodology/approach –Using a trust transfer theory framework and 15 semi-structured
interviews, this study identi ﬁes the sources people rely on to build trust in robo-advice.
Findings –The authors highlight four themes –social in ﬂuence, psychological comfort, safeguarding and
compliance and personal capacity –that shape individuals ’trust in robo-advice. In addition to direct trust in
robo-advice, ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust and system trust can also transfer to trust in robo-advice. This study ﬁnds that

ﬁnancial literacy and risk tolerance moderate individuals ’trust in robo-advice, while psychological comfort
ﬁrst shapes trust and then drives adoption. The ﬁndings suggest that even young, tech-savvy individuals may
not fully bene ﬁt from robo-advice due to low personal capability. They also prefer a hybrid model, where
combining robo-advice with traditional advisory services could offer greater bene ﬁts.
Originality/value –This study details the concept of trust in the robo-advice context into three dimensions:
technology trust, ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust and system trust. Existing research on robo-advice lacks quantitative tests on
ﬁrm-speci ﬁc and systemic trust; therefore, this qualitative exploratory study offers foundational theoretical insights.

1. Introduction
Traditional ﬁnancial advice is provided by high-quality ﬁnancial advisors with expertise and
experience, making it cost-intensive and expensive ( Tiberius et al. ,2 0 2 2 ). Roughly 6% of
Australians can afford traditional ﬁnancial advice, and only 3% of the population aged 21 –34
receive ﬁnancial advice ( ARdata, 2022 ). Robo-advice is a FinTech service that uses arti ﬁcial
intelligence (AI) to automatically provide digital ﬁnancial advice ( Taoet al.,2 0 2 1 ). Algorithms
can act as human ﬁnancial advisors to provide affordable ﬁnancial advice ( Tiberius et al.,2 0 2 2 ),
and robo-advice is a virtual platform that is easily accessible ( Isaia and Oggero, 2022 ;Lourenço
et al. , 2022 ). Accordingly, the Australian government reports that robo-advice could be an
alternative approach to traditional ﬁnancial advisory services, helping individuals access
affordable professional ﬁnancial advice and potentially helping to improve ﬁnancial well-being
(Callaghan et al.,2 0 2 0 ). Existing research has found robo-advice is suitable for investors with
limited investment experience ( Jung et al. , 2019 ) and groups who are not able to afford
traditional ﬁnancial advisory services, such as young people and low-income individuals
(Brenner and Meyll, 2020 ;Bai, 2021 ;Baulkaran and Jain, 2023 ).
However, the adoption of robo-advice remains low ( Awet al., 2023 ;Belanche et al., 2019 ;
Belanche et al., 2023 ;Flavián et al., 2022 ;Tiberius et al.,2 0 2 2 ), with roughly 1% of Australians
adults having used robo-advice ( ASIC, 2019 ). This is primarily due to a lack of trust ( Bedué and
Fritzsche, 2021 ;Nourallah, 2023 ;Zhu et al. , 2024 ). For innovative technologies, trust is a
prerequisite for adoption ( Belanche et al., 2019 ), which determines whether an individual is willing
to adopt robo-advice ( Eren, 2023 ;Nourallah et al.,2 0 2 2 ;Rohet al., 2022 ). In the context of robo-
advice, trust means individuals believe that robo-advice is honest and benevolent and prior itises their
best interests (see Grayson et al.,2 0 0 8 ). Trust is a shortcut in personal ﬁnancial decision-making
(Smith, 2009 ), as it determines whether an individual is willing to establish connections with
banking, ﬁnancial advisors or other ﬁnancial services, such as robo-advice ( Bruhn, 2019 )a n d
actively seeking ﬁnancial advice ( Calcagno and Monticone, 2015 ;Kramer, 2016 ).
Theﬁnancial services industry is shifting its focus on building trust from traditional in-
person interactions to AI-driven advisory engagements ( Goldstein et al., 2019 ). Nonetheless,
research towards trust and robo-advice remains limited ( Brenner and Meyll, 2020 ;Bhatia
et al. , 2021 ;Gillath et al. , 2021 ;Hendershott et al. ,2 0 2 1 ;Nourallah et al. , 2022 ).Venkatesh
et al. (2016) emphasise the necessity of broadening trust within the uni ﬁed theory of
acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), as trust can positively in ﬂuence the application
of digital technology ( D’Acunto et al. , 2019 ;Werth et al. , 2023 ).Nourallah (2023) builds on
this by adding trust into the UTAUT, examining the initial trust of young investors in robo-advice, presenting the statistical relationships between trust and in ﬂuence factors and
providing speculative explanations. Most existing research on robo-advice is empirical,
failing to provide a deeper understanding of the phenomena of people ’s lack of trust in robo-
advice ( Belanche et al. , 2023 ), and robo-advice requires extended new theoretical theories
(Barone et al., 2024 ).QRFM

=== Page 3 ===
This study aims to understand the process of individuals building trust in robo-advice,
driven by the research question: How do different sources in ﬂuence individuals ’trust in robo-
advice? Namely, we shift from focusing on “what ”inﬂuences individuals ’trust in robo-
advice to explaining the “how”, that is, individuals ’psychological process of building trust.
Using a qualitative approach to gather raw data, this study develops a conceptual model
based on trust transfer theory to explain why people trust or do not trust robo-advice. By
applying this theory, this study highlights that trust in robo-advice is also process-based (see
Zucker, 1986 ). Existing research involving trust only focuses on technology trust ( Eren,
2023 ;Nourallah et al. , 2022 ;Nourallah, 2023 ). However, in addition to the direct trust
clients have in robo-advice (technology trust), we highlight that individuals ’ﬁrm-speci ﬁc
trust and system trust can also transfer to their trust in robo-advice. These extendeddimensions of trust in robo-advice could inform and support future quantitative research.
This study also extends the existing robot implementation framework (see Belanche et al. ,
2020 ) to the robo-advice context, supplementing details of how robo-advice design,
customer features and service encounter characteristics affect individuals ’trust, which in
turn, affects their behavioural intentions.
The rest of the study is as follows. Section 2 reviews the related theoretical background.
Section 3 outlines the methodology used in this study, followed by Section 4, which details
the data analysis. Section 5 presents the ﬁndings, and Section 6 introduces the conceptual
model with discussions and concludes the study, highlighting its contributions and
limitations.
2. Theoretical background
2.1 De ﬁnitions of trust
In this study, trust aligns with the concept of trust in the business context, where it is seen as
the belief that robo-advice is honest and benevolent, with a certain level of capability, and
acts in the best interests of clients ( Grayson et al. , 2008 ). Trust, as explained by Johnson-
George and Swap (1982) , comprises cognition-based trust and affect-based trust. Cognition-
based trust is based on personal knowledge or “good reasons ”, such as records ( Lewis and
Weigert, 1985 , p. 970). On the other hand, affect-based trust is formed through emotional
connections between two parties ( McAllister, 1995 ).
For a new technology product or service, individuals might build ex ante trust before
direct interaction through the impact of reliable third parties ( Dupont and Karpoff, 2020 ).
When ﬁrst exposed to new things, individuals could generate initial trust, which is
particularly important for businesses attracting clients ( McKnight et al. , 2002 ). Accordingly,
trust in FinTech services is multidimensional, and it is necessary to consider the potential
inﬂuence of other stakeholders on individuals ’trust in robo-advice, including robo-advice
providers and governments.
For this study, technology trust is related to robo-advice itself. The reputation of the
service provider, user feedback and relatives ’recommendations can affect ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust
(Grayson et al.,2 0 0 8 ). Additionally, robo-advice in Australia is regulated by the government
(ASIC, 2019 ). System trust can be established through uni ﬁed rules, such as laws and
regulations, as well as guarantees and protections ( Zucker, 1986 ). Therefore, in this study,
trust involves three dimensions:
(1) technology trust ( Xiaet al. , 2023 );
(2)ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust ( Grayson et al. , 2008 ); and
(3) system trust ( Grayson et al. , 2008 ;Xiaet al. , 2023 ).Qualitative

2.2 Trust transfer theory
Trust transfer theory posits that “transfer occurs from better-known to less well-known
targets, and perhaps an unknown target could increase perceived trustworthiness by sending
a link to a trusted target ”(Stewart, 2003 , p. 14). Technology itself is not a moral issue, but it
does participate in social relationships, and people can build trust in it ( Belanche et al. ,
2014 ). Trust transfer theory offers a comprehensive explanation of how various entities and
contexts related to new technologies in ﬂuence people ’s trust. Trust can be transferred within
the same channel, for example, when trust in one website extends to an unfamiliar site
through hyperlinks ( Xiao et al.,2 0 1 9 ). Alternatively, trust can transfer freely between of ﬂine
and online contexts ( Shao et al. , 2022 ). For instance, people ’s trust in public administration
inﬂuences their trust in public electronic services ( Belanche et al., 2014 ). Additionally, word-
of-mouth serves as an informal source of information, making individuals more likely to
trust online retailers before directly engaging with them ( Kuan and Bock, 2007 ). Trust
transfer theory has been well applied in areas such as e-commerce ( Kuan and Bock, 2007 ;
Xiao et al. , 2019 ), blockchain ( Shao et al. , 2022 ) and public electronic services ( Belanche
et al. , 2014 ), but limited application in the ﬁeld of robo-advice. This study will also address
that gap.
2.3 Technology trust
The current low adoption rate of robo-advice among Australians ( ASIC, 2019 ) indicates that
most people lack the prior experience needed to build trust in this technology ( Kim et al. ,
2009 ;Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa, 2004 ). For new digital advisory services, individuals ’
initial trust is typically grounded on instinctive irrational emotions, increasing their
likelihood of trust ( Kim et al., 2009 ). A positive attitude re ﬂects an affective tendency to trust
(Yang and Wibowo, 2022 ), suggesting that individuals believe that they will be treated
reliably ( McKnight et al. , 1998 ). Optimistic clients tend to have positive attitudes towards
new investment opportunities, like robo-advice ( Flavián et al. , 2022 ). However, negative
attitudes towards potential unsatisfactory performance or fraud of robo-advice ( Brenner and
Meyll, 2020 ;D’Hondt et al. , 2020 ) could lower individuals ’propensity to trust robo-advice
(Gillath et al., 2021 ;Schoorman et al., 2007 ).
Unlike traditional ﬁnancial services, which involve emotional interaction, robo-advice
lacks personal touch and face-to-face interaction, making it dif ﬁcult for clients to generate
affect-based trust (see McAllister, 1995 ). While robo-advice can avoid the negative effects of
human emotions on ﬁnancial decision-making ( Bai, 2021 ), robo-advice is unable to
sensitively recognise and respond to clients ’emotional needs, nor adjust portfolios based on
sudden emotional issues ( Bhatia et al. , 2021 ). Furthermore, the absence of human
involvement may cause clients to panic during uncertainties and emergencies ( Isaia and
Oggero, 2022 ), increasing clients ’concerns about decision risks ( Dalla Pozza et al. , 2017 )
and lowering trust in algorithm-driven services ( Gulati et al., 2019 ).
Security is crucial for individuals evaluating a new technology ( Belanche et al. , 2023 ),
with perceived security positively affecting individuals ’trust in robo-advice and shaping
their adoption intentions ( Rohet al. , 2023 ). Robo-advice requires mandatory authorisations
to access individual information ( Xiaet al., 2023 ). Consequently, clients are concerned about
potential threats such as data breaches, abuse, hacking and fraud ( Belanche et al. , 2023 ;
McKnight et al., 2002 ), which can undermine their trust ( Gulati et al., 2019 ).
If individuals can perceive the innovation or bene ﬁts of new technologies before and
during their adoption, it helps them establish a trust relationship ( Koufaris and Hampton-
Sosa, 2004 ) and reduces their perceived risks of using robo-advice ( Xiaet al. , 2023 ). For
example, individuals will begin to trust robo-advice if they perceive it as easy to use andQRFM

=== Page 5 ===
useful ( Nourallah, 2023 ). However, because robo-advice assesses risk pro ﬁles only through a
survey with limited questions for speci ﬁc time periods ( Bhatia et al., 2021 ), there is room for
error, potentially resulting in an inappropriate portfolio. This would make it dif ﬁcult for the
clients to recognise the usefulness of robo-advice, potentially reducing their likelihood of
trusting robo-advice ( Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa, 2004 ).
2.4 Firm-speci ﬁc trust
Firm-speci ﬁc trust can develop from information gathered through direct interactions and
second-hand sources ( Grayson et al. ,2 0 0 8 ), such as company-related news, government
endorsement and user feedback that can affect individuals ’attitudes ( McKnight et al.,2 0 0 2 ).
When individuals lack experience with new technology, the provider ’s reputation becomes
crucial for building trust ( Kim et al. , 2009 ;McKnight et al. , 2002 ), because a strong
reputation re ﬂects a trustworthy history and public recognition, increasing individuals ’
conﬁdence in the future activities ( Karbowski and Ramsza, 2017 ). A positive reputation can
transfer trust in the provider to its services and products ( Johnson and Grayson, 2005 ;
Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa, 2004 ). This is also important for AI providers, where a positive
reputation serves as a crucial precursor in establishing trust, signifying their commitment to
meeting clients ’needs ( Yang and Wibowo, 2022 ). The positive relationship between
reputation and trust, in turn, impacts preferred choices ( Dupont and Karpoff, 2020 ). Given
that many individuals have limited experience with robo-advice or even traditional ﬁnancial
advisory services, a provider ’s reputation could be essential in initial trust.
The strong capacities of providers can positively affect individuals ’trust in the technology,
such as the ease of use and usefulness of the platform ( Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa, 2004 )
and the expertise exhibited by AI services ( Yen and Chiang, 2021 ), which is re ﬂected in the
ability to provide accurate, effective and complete information content ( Kim et al.,2 0 2 1 ). For
robo-advice, different providers use varying algorithms, resulting in disparities in the content
and quality of robo-advice. Some robo-advice providers may offer only general ﬁnancial
advice, while other providers use advanced algorithms enabling their robo-advice service topersonalise ﬁnancial advice tailored to clients ’input and needs ( Tiberius et al. ,2 0 2 2 ). When
individuals perceive a high level of expertise and tangible performance, such as ﬁnancial
advice provided by robo-advice move them to a better situation, will enhance their trust(Gulati et al.,2 0 1 9 ;Johnson and Grayson, 2005 ;Rohet al.,2 0 2 2 ).
As mentioned before, individuals value secure technology, and the essence of these
threats (potential ﬁnancial losses) lies in the leakage and misuse of clients ’private
information ( Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa, 2004 ;Roh et al. ,2 0 2 3 ). Privacy issues are
particularly signi ﬁcant in the context of AI, where clients cannot identify whether algorithms
misuse their information for learning or if employees with access unethically use their
personal information ( Zhu et al. , 2020 ). Providers who proactively address privacy issues
and formulate protection policies are perceived as more trustworthy ( Roh et al. , 2022 )
because individuals perceive the security control from providers towards the platform can
increase their ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust ( Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa, 2004 ).
2.5 System trust
In Australia, FinTech ﬁrms providing robo-advice are regulated under existing traditional
ﬁnancial service frameworks and speci ﬁc regulatory guidelines, such as RG 255 ( ASIC,
2019 ). System trust complements individuals ’trust in technologies ( Yang and Wibowo,
2022 ).Dupont and Karpoff (2020) highlight that government regulations and supervision
can reduce speculative behaviours and help potential clients build ex ante trust. When clients
understand that AI ’s data collection complies with legal requirements, they are more inclinedQualitative

=== Page 6 ===
to trust the provider and its services ( Lobschat et al. , 2021 ;McKnight et al. , 2002 ). This is
because regulations-backed legal protection gives clients con ﬁdence that their ﬁnances and
information are secure during the robo-advisory process ( Kim et al., 2009 ;Luoet al., 2010 ).
3. Methodology
3.1 Design
Lourenço et al. (2022) empirical research indicates that individuals with a bachelor ’s degree
or higher are more predisposed to accept digital ﬁnance advice. Moreover, Figà-Talamanca
et al. (2022) empirical research indicates that gender differences in accepting robo-advice
among the highly educated population have been eliminated. In a context where the adoptionrate among Australian adults stands at 1% ( ASIC, 2019 ), this study aligns with previous
research ( Zhang et al. , 2021 ;Figà-Talamanca et al. , 2022 ;Nourallah et al. , 2022 ;Nourallah,
2023 ), setting inexperienced young university students as the research sample to focus on
individuals who are most likely to become the primary client base of robo-advice. Awet al.
(2023) focus on non-robo-advice users as “the primary aim of the study is to understand
factors of robo-advisor resistance ”(p. 8). Similarly, this study ’s purpose is to investigate and
explain why some individuals do not trust robo-advice, and trust serves as a prerequisite forengaging with robo-advice ( Gillath et al. , 2021 ). If an individual has already used or is
currently using robo-advice, the trust could naturally underpin these behaviours ( Nourallah
et al., 2022 ). We followed Nourallah et al. (2022) screening criteria, setting young university
students aged from 18 to 29 as the sample, to ensure demographic homogeneity and reducebias ( Sarstedt et al., 2018 ).
We developed open-ended semi-structured interviews based on literature reviews
(DiCicco-Bloom and Crabtree, 2006 ;Tiberius et al. , 2021 ), facilitating participants in freely
offering and complementing their insights, while also providing explanatory notes ( Graebner
et al.,2 0 1 2 ). Existing studies on the trust relationship between young people and robo-advice
reveal either a positive or negative correlation through the veri ﬁcation of hypotheses (see
Nourallah et al. , 2022 ;Nourallah, 2023 ). Qualitative research enables researchers to explore
the worldview of speci ﬁc minority populations rather than focusing solely on hypotheses
from large samples ( Boddy, 2016 ;Azungah, 2018 ). This study seeks to achieve a deeper
understanding of the reasons behind the factors in ﬂuencing young people ’s trust in robo-
advice and the process of building trust, offer a more comprehensive explanation of theexisting literature and contribute to the further development of a theory ( Jacobides, 2005 ;
Graebner et al., 2012 ).
Based on Leeet al. ’s (1999) theory elaboration, our study is both deductive and inductive.
Collecting data within a theoretical context allows for the re ﬂection of the research theme
(deductive), the data collection process is designed to be open to capture new insights orexpanding insights through participants ’social knowledge and experiences (inductive). This
approach assists researchers gain a deep comprehension of and explaining which reliable
sources individuals can depend on to build trust in robo-advice.
Hennink and Kaiser (2022) conduct a systematic review analysis focusing on data
saturation and ﬁnd that saturation can be achieved with a minimum of nine interviews.
However, qualitative research focuses on the explanation of the phenomena of the speci ﬁc
groups, rather than the number of responses ( Bhatia et al. , 2020 ). The previous sample
experience can only serve as a reference range for the number of participants ( Saunders and
Townsend, 2016 ), as the purpose and context of each study are different ( Braun and Clarke,
2021 ). Thus, this study prioritises data saturation over the number of participants. When no
more innovative ideas, new concepts or codes are produced, the qualitative data reachQRFM

=== Page 7 ===
saturation ( Guest et al. , 2006 ). This study conducted a total of 15 individual interviews and
reached saturation in the sixth.
3.2 Data collection and participants
Given accounting, ﬁnance, FinTech and ﬁnancial planning students are likely to have a better
understanding of robo-advice and therefore may be more inclined to trust it, there could be a
risk of bias. To address this, we ensured data was collected from students in different majors
through purposive sampling. However, students in related majors were not completely
excluded as they can have different perspectives from students in non-related majors ( Bedué
and Fritzsche, 2021 ). Further, international students were included to increase the diversity
of descriptive responses ( Nourallah et al. , 2022 ) as Australia is a multicultural country, with
a 29.5% overseas-born population ( ABS, 2023 ).
Interviews were conducted in Australian universities, offered in-person or virtually (via
Microsoft Teams) depending on the participants ’preferences. We also clari ﬁed the audio-
recording requirements, the purpose of the interview and the interview process. At the
beginning of the interviews, participants were able to receive detailed information about
robo-advice, including how they work and their characteristics. Accordingly, participants ’
responses are based on their personal perspective of how their level of trust in robo-advice
might potentially be in ﬂuenced. Table 1 provides descriptive details of the participants.
All participants are university students, aged between 18 and 27. All participants
expressed that they use digital technology daily and enjoy the ease and comfort that online
shopping, online banking and mobile payments. Of the total of 15 individual interviews, 11
were conducted face-to-face and four were conducted virtually through Microsoft Teams.
The total interview time was 340.8 min, which exceeded the duration of the previous robo-
advice study (see Bhatia et al., 2021 ).
4. Analysis
The interviews were conducted in English and transcribed. Based on Braun and Clarke
(2006) thematic analysis framework and Al-Eisawi (2022) coding guidance, we generate

theories through a three-stage coding process. In the ﬁrst stage (S1), we read and familiarise
ourselves with all the interviews ’transcriptions, performing initial encoding. To avoid
missing important information, we adhere to Strauss and Corbin (1998) line-by-line open
coding method. Three participants (ID 1, 2 and 10) have educational backgrounds beyond
undergraduate degrees (see Table 1 ), and they did not offer any innovative ideas.
In the second stage (S2), to clarify the relationships between codes and capture main
concepts, we use Leximancer to semi-automatically analyse the relationships within the
entire data set. Leximancer is considered a more objective analysis tool and is capable of
automatically constructing a theoretical concept map, facilitating data visualisation
(Sotiriadou et al. , 2014 ). In Figure 1 , Leximancer identi ﬁed eight concepts, some of which
were related to each other, and all were identi ﬁed through the initial coding process (S1).
However, Leximancer ’s automation limits the comprehensive interpretation of data.
Therefore, we through iterative manual analysis to gain a complete understanding of the data
and generate detailed explanations. We compare the similarities and differences between
codes, understand their relationships and close codes to extract the main concepts.
Figure 1. Contextual relationshipsQRFM

=== Page 9 ===
In the third stage (S3), we use selective coding ( Glaser, 1978 ) to analyse whether the core
concepts (obtained from S2) can be integrated into the theoretical framework based onliterature ( Sarker et al. , 2013 ) or if new themes are emerging ( Walker and Myrick, 2006 ).
This study aims to explain how other stakeholders of robo-advice affect individuals ’trust in
robo-advice. Based on the coding principles outlined by Sarker et al. (2013) , the core factors
in the theoretical framework –technology trust, ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust and system trust –serve as
predetermined themes. These themes allow us to use explanatory data to con ﬁrm or refute
the hypotheses and relationships proposed in previous studies ( Bedué and Fritzsche, 2021 ).
By further re ﬁning the themes, we renamed the broader themes to explain the factors that
inﬂuence people ’s trust in robo-advice, focusing on dimensions such as social in ﬂuence,
psychological comfort, safeguarding and compliance and personal capacity (see Table 2 ).

The study participants, with an average age of 21, have an open attitude towards technology.
However, most of them expressed a lack of trust in robo-advice. To explore this, we added a
question probing why participants viewed robo-advice differently despite it being a form of
technology. The main reason was concerning future consequences:
Especially with ﬁnances, being on the internet can get very risky, people get very talented with
technology, especially when it comes to hacking (ID 6).
Weﬁnd that recommendations or feedback towards robo-advice from trusted and reliable
third parties, such as friends, can positively impact initial trust in robo-advice. As
participants already have strong trust relationships with friends, this trust can effectively
extend to robo-advice. One participant expressed:
If my friends have been okay with robo-advice and told me that is okay, I will trust it. Because my
friends, they are not going to lie to me and put me at risk of losing, like doing anything dodgy (ID 7).
The government could act as a reliable third party; however, only a few interviewees
believed that:
if the government endorses it, then people would like to trust it more (ID 15).
Over half of the participants indicated that even if the governments endorsed robo-advice, it
would not positively affect their attitudes or willingness to use robo-advice. As one
participant explained:
The government does not know me, it might be the best thing for the government, but not
necessarily for me (ID 5).
Consequently, the government ’s endorsement has minimal in ﬂuence on young, educated
individuals ’trust in robo-advice.
Participants stated that large providers are more reliable than smaller ones, valuing their
long-term operating records and ﬁnancial resources. Such preference for larger companies is
cognition-based trust, which can transfer to the robo-advice. As one participant explained:
Robo-advice ’performance depends on their internal technology [algorithms], so the stronger
banks or companies can invest more in the technology, and then the more accurate information therobo-advice can provide. So, the strength of the company behind the robo-advice determineswhether I should trust it (ID 1).
Although as digital natives, participants highlighted that online reputation cannot be fully
trusted and they prefer word-of-mouth reputation and trust the brands that have stood the test
of time. One participant explained:
Because trust behind it. That would come with age because if it were not trustworthy, it would not
stay around for exceptionally long (ID 7).
Some participants also consider the developers behind the robo-advice. If reputable experts
develop the algorithm, they feel more con ﬁdent in trusting robo-advice. Their cognitive and
affective trust will be shaped by “experienced and highly regarded people ”(ID 13), then
transfer to the robo-advice. For example:QRFM

=== Page 11 ===
Trust depends on the algorithm's strength, particularly if it has some big ﬁnancial people behind it,
like economists and proven ﬁnancial advisors, which will de ﬁnitely help increase trust (ID 12).
5.2 Psychological comfort
Trust is built on familiarity, one participant stated that:
I think in familiar things, there is already trust there and it ’s probably convenient as well (ID 14).
Because familiar experiences can provide psychological expectations, reducing uncertainty
and enhancing trust. For example, people could transfer their trust in familiar providers to
robo-advice:
It depends if I am super familiar with it. I would want to make sure that this was a credible process
before I start putting information about my ﬁnances online, and I would feel I had already been
comfortable with the processes. [ …] If the speci ﬁc bank I used recommended it, it would be more
likely for me to choose, just something that I'm already familiar with (ID 8).
The algorithms used by robo-advice can appear as black boxes to users because they cannot
see the analysis process behind the ﬁnalﬁnancial advice. People ’s trust in robo-advice could
be boosted by providing suf ﬁcient explanations on how the algorithms work. One participant
expressed that:
If their algorithm actually has some kind of explanation as to how it works, like there will be
transparency in that. I would not have any problem with that if it can make the analysis process andthe decision-making process more transparent and there are enough decision explanations (ID 11).
In addition to explaining the decision-making basis of robo-advice, participants also
expressed a desire for explaining the content of ﬁnancial advice provided by robo-advisory.
For example:
[…]if it offered support, like constant support services to go along with it, like more explanation
about the decision, it would make people trust them more (ID 7).
Accordingly, the interpretability is important, which could be improved though an:
[…]education program through it that would help teach you about what ’s going on and inform
you, so that you don ’t feel left in the dark (ID 8).
Accordingly, improving the transparency and interpretability of robo-advice could reduce
clients ’anxiety and provide more peace of mind, which in turn, help them build trust in robo-
advice.
Another controversial point is the lack of human involvement in robo-advice. The
positive aspect is that an online survey is easy to use, one said, “I could do it on my own time,
and I don ’t have to set up a meeting with somebody ”(ID 8). Without emotional bias,
investors can bene ﬁt from the unbiased and data-driven nature of the advice because:
[…]people ’s emotions and their own life experience, maybe change a little bit the advice that they
give(ID 14).
However, individuals need human touch and the lack of emotional communication and
interaction may lead to challenges in understanding the context and providing personalised
advice. This could negatively affect individuals ’trust in robo-advice, because clients “would
be easy to trust robo-advice with high quality ”(ID 14). As explained by a participant:
I choose a human because I think they can individualise it better, they can show more empathy,
they can understand you, and so that will give better advice. I do not think a robo-advice wouldQualitative

work as well as talking to a human advisor because I know there is not much information you can
get out of a quick survey, and it would make them have to categorise you into broader categories,they cannot understand you clearly (ID 7).
In the case of a technical failure or security breach, clients may experience panic and anxiety.
Participants expressed the desire to have someone behind the scenes providing support in
such scenarios. For instance:
I would want someone behind the scenes helping me just in case. If my software goes down, to
whom do I talk? What if there is a problem here? What happens if the technology breaks down? Orthere is a glitch? Or if there is something that goes on? (ID 13).
Accordingly, a hybrid model combining human advisors and robo-advice is favoured, which
may yield optimal results in digital ﬁnancial advice:
I feel like probably a combination of humans and robo-advice. Because I feel that computers have
algorithms, and they do maths well. But human interaction is important as well (ID 5).
5.3 Safeguarding and compliance
As detailed before, privacy security is crucial in shaping people ’s trust in robo-advice,
regardless of whether data security (hacking) or personal privacy (leaks), which all lead to
ﬁnancial losses. Most respondents expressed a desire for their information to be securely
protected and preserved and not shared without their consent:
My only concern would be the privacy aspect since you have to upload so much information into
one database. If there were a breach or if somebody hacked into that technology, so muchinformation would be available for them, to take off your bank accounts (ID 10).
While some participants understand that robo-advice requires suf ﬁcient information for
analysis, privacy concerns remain. One participant noted:
It is pretty necessary to give robo-advice information because they need that to work. But I would
worry about it being in databases that are potentially accessible to people that should not haveaccess to it (ID 7).
We found that most participants rely on legal regulations and other protection from providers
to build their trust in robo-advice. Because:
[…]when talking about something that is pro ﬁt-driven, you [clients] want to make sure that the
users ’interest is kept in mind. The legislations probably have helped towards that (ID 11).
Such as:
[…]more regulation against AI, [particularly] the amount of data in the process, to prevent data
spilled out (ID 12).
Interviewees also have positive attitudes towards the providers that actively supervise their
products and services, clearly explain policies and prioritise clients ’interests. One
participant explained:
[…]if they [the provider] tell you what they can and cannot do and why, because of these laws, I
will trust a company more (ID 8).
Another interviewee stated:
I would need the protection policy to be explained to me in detail before I can go. I do not trust it if
it is just like ‘don ’t worry, you ’re protected ’, there is no proof here (ID 9).QRFM

=== Page 13 ===
Therefore, this perceived security from regulations and providers ’protection could transfer
their system trust and ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust to the robo-advice.
5.4 Personal capability
Robo-advice relies on online surveys to collect clients ’data, making data quality crucial for
accurate advice. Clients with limited ﬁnancial literacy may feel stressed, as one respondent
stated:
I think it would require the users themselves to have a greater [ ﬁnancial] understanding. Otherwise,
we are getting a different kind of experience, I am not that economically literate. I guess if the userdoes not really know what they want, it is dif ﬁcult for the machine to tell them (ID 11).
Consequently, the advice provided may not be suitable for their actual needs, leading to a
negative user experience.
Furthermore, as mentioned in Section 5.1, high-quality information helps individuals
establish trust relationships with robo-advice, while low ﬁnancial literacy hinders individuals
from assessing the information quality of robo-advice. One participant expressed:
I would have to check with a ﬁnancial advisor to get a nice baseline (ID10).
When individuals struggle to perceive the usefulness and applicability of advice provided by
robo-advice, building trust becomes challenging.
The participants indicated that their satisfaction was linked to their capacity to tolerate
losses. Risk tolerance does not directly lower trust. Poor performance –whether due to
limitations in robo-advice expertise, clients ’ﬁnancial literacy, or security issues –can
weaken personal trust. Consequently, when unsatis ﬁed performance occurs, individuals with
lower risk tolerance are likely to express a lower level of trust. For instance:
[…]if the loss exceeds the baseline, I will not trust it anymore and do not give it a second
chance (ID 3).
6. Discussions
6.1 The conceptual model of building trust in robo-advice
Our research identi ﬁes the key foundations for individuals to build trust in robo-advice,
highlighting that this trust involves three dimensions:
(1) technology trust (trust in the robo-advice itself);
(2)ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust; and
(3) system trust.
Based on our ﬁndings and trust transfer theory, we constructed the conceptual model (see
Figure 2 ) to visualise the pathway of personal trust in robo-advice. We found that, in addition
to the direct trust in robo-advice, their trust can also be transferred to robo-advice through
ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust and system trust. Additionally, the level of individuals ’ﬁnancial literacy
and risk tolerance can moderate their direct trust in robo-advice.
Contrary to the ﬁndings of Isaia and Oggero (2022) ,w eﬁnd that young individuals with
extensive experience in online shopping, online banking and mobile payments hesitate to
trust robo-advice. This is because they are concerned about potential ﬁnancial losses caused
by their private information being hacked or leaked. Such anxiety could restrict individuals ’
trust in robo-advice. Moreover, consistent with previous FinTech studies ( Xiaet al. , 2023 ;
Roh et al. ,2 0 2 3 ), we underscore the positive in ﬂuence of institutional protection andQualitative
Research in
Financial Markets

=== Page 14 ===
regulations on individuals ’perceptions of security and privacy. These develop individuals ’
ﬁrm-speci ﬁc and system trust, thereby indirectly enhancing their trust in robo-advice.
Nourallah et al. (2022) argue that young people ’s widespread access to online information
contributes to the establishment of initial trust in robo-advice. However, our ﬁndings
challenge that assertion. Participants in our study expressed scepticism regarding online
reputation and, instead, exhibited greater trust in of ﬂine word-of-mouth reputation and
recommendations from close social relationships. With related information about different
stakeholders and robo-advice gathered and processed, their trust could increase or decrease,
indicating the trust in robo-advice is process-based (see Grayson et al.,2 0 0 8 ).
This study emphasises the role of psychological comfort in building individuals ’trust in
robo-advice. Our ﬁndings show that the familiar providers offer a sense of security, which
reduces perceived risks before and during the use of robo-advice. Individuals with low-risk
tolerance tend to feel more concerned about the potential future consequences of robo-advice
because the high costs can arise from misplaced trust in ﬁnancial services ( Bruhn, 2019 ).
Aligning with Roongruangsee and Patterson (2023) ﬁndings, we also ﬁnd that the lack of
human involvement and interpretability lowers psychological comfort. However, our ﬁndings
highlight low psychological comfort ﬁrst reduces individuals ’trust, rather than directly
decreasing their intention to use robo-advice, which details the decision-making process of
robo-advice adoption and shows the mediating effect of psychological comfort on trust.
Consistent with previous research ( Jünger and Mietzner, 2020 ), our study highlights the
signiﬁcance of ﬁnancial literacy in robo-advice. Individuals who possess certain levels of
ﬁnancial literacy and risk tolerance are more likely to place trust in robo-advice, which may
positively in ﬂuence their adoption intentions. However, young people generally have lower
ﬁnancial literacy ( Lusardi et al. , 2010 ), and they are in the early stages of accumulating their
ﬁnancial foundation, displaying lower risk tolerance ( Grable, 2000 ). This contradicts the
existing research ( Brenner and Meyll, 2020 ) suggesting that robo-advice is primarily suitable
for young individuals and low-income groups.

6.2 Theoretical and practical implications
This study contributes to the research gap concerning trust between people and robo-adviceby thoroughly exploring how various stakeholders in ﬂuence individuals ’trust in robo-
advice. It extends the concept of trust in the robo-advice context into three dimensions:
technology trust, ﬁrm-speci ﬁc trust, and system trust.
Existing research on robo-advice lacks quantitative tests on ﬁrm-speci ﬁca n d
systemic trust, this qualitative exploratory study provides foundational theoreticalperspectives. Additionally, this study ﬁlls a gap in robo-advice literature from a client
perspective (
Belanche et al. ,2 0 2 3 ) and highlights the positive role of psychological
comfort in building individuals ’trust in robo-advice. Aligning with Zhu et al. (2024)
literature review, our study also ﬁnds that individuals would like to seek additional
conﬁrmation from human advisors and value empathy. This preference may be due to
lowﬁnancial literacy and risk tolerance, and human interactions provide individuals
with greater peace of mind and help establish a foundation of trust in robo-advice.Further, Belanche et al. (2020) framework suggests that robot design, customer features
and service encounter characteristics determine whether client engagement with AI-
driven service robots. Our study extends it into the robo-advice context and provides
insights into how each dimension in ﬂuences trust and subsequently shapes individuals ’
engagement intentions.
This study highlights that the ﬁnancial services industry may bene ﬁt from adopting a
hybrid model that integrates both trad itional and digital advisory services. Such a model
may reduce the cost of obtaining ﬁnancial advice while supplementing interaction and
empathy in robo-advisory. Furthermore, this study ﬁnds that the transparency and
interpretation of the algorithm positively affect individuals ’trust in robo-advice,
offering a direction for developers to improve the service systems. World-of-mouth
reputation is also important for FinTech companies; however, small companies mayface more challenges in establishing trust relationships with potential clients. Therefore,
we recommend that the government take more responsibility in promoting r obo-advice
by supporting and educating individuals in its use. For instance, the government could
collaborate with robo-advice providers to provide free ﬁnancial seminars and attempt to
connect traditional famous banks with the robo-advice industry. These could encourage
more individuals to engage with affordable digital ﬁnancial advice, helping to close
ﬁnancial literacy gaps and meet the growing need for ﬁnancial advice among
Australians.
6.3 Limitations and future research
The sample of this study does not represent all young, educated people, and the ﬁndings may
not be applicable to other populations. Although all participants received education about
robo-advice before the interviews, they lacked using experience, meaning their responses
reﬂect their perceptions. All participants were aware we were discussing robo-advice within
an Australian context and were living in Australia at the time of the interviews. However,
including international students could introduce bias when analysing the responses to
questions regarding system trust when from backgrounds where different regulationsoperate.
Despite these limitations, this study contributes to understanding the implicit expenses
associated with the lack of trust in robo-advice, potentially improving accessibility to assist a
larger population in obtaining affordable digital ﬁnancial advice. This, in turn, could foster
digital and ﬁnancial inclusion and strengthen commitment to ﬁnancial innovation. Although
it seems reasonable not to completely trust robo-advice, understanding why people do notQualitative

trust robo-advice is still crucial. Future research could address this research gap by
supplementing quantitative works for different dimensions of trust in robo-advice.
