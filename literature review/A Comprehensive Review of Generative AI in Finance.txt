1. Introduction
The intersection of generative AI (GAI) and finance has emerged as a rapidly de-
veloping area of research and application, revolutionizing various facets of the financial
industry. GAI encompasses a broad range of models, such as variational autoencoders
(VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and dif-
fusion models. It has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing financial analytics,
improving decision-making processes, and generating synthetic financial data for various
applications. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent trends
and advancements in GAI’s application within the financial sector.
Before the advent of GAI models, traditional methods for financial text mining were
primarily used to analyze financial reports and forecast stock prices. However, these meth-
ods often relied on the bag-of-words approach to generate word embeddings, which failed
to capture the contextual information within sentences. In contrast, pre-trained LLMs,
which leverage transformer architecture, are able to capture the complex dependency rela-
tionships between words, resulting in more nuanced and contextually aware embeddings.
Consequently, GAI models, such as LLMs, have shown significant potential to enhance
various financial tasks [ 1]. Over the past few years, there has been a growing body of
research investigating how GAI can address these tasks, evaluating both the results and
the associated risks.
In this paper, we aim to evaluate the current state of research on GAI in finance
and provide guidance for newcomers in this field. Notably, Ding et al. [ 2] conducted an
extensive analysis of LLMs, while Li et al. [ 3] provided a broader perspective by examining
the current advancements in LLM techniques and their applications. However, neither
study explores the intricate relationship between GAI and finance in detail. Lee et al. [ 4]
offered surveys that focus specifically on the impact of LLMs in finance, though they do

not address other GAI models, and their topics were predefined manually. Additionally,
Barde and Kulkarni [ 5], Krause [ 6], and Mbanyele [ 7] concentrated on general-purpose
LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing AI.
However, our paper expands the scope by exploring the intersection of GAI and
finance, going beyond the focus on LLMs. Additionally, we utilize the advanced topic
modeling technique, BERTopic [ 8], to systematically cluster and analyze the existing re-
search. By leveraging the BERTopic model, we introduce a novel framework for catego-
rizing the current body of work on GAI in finance. In light of the identified gaps and the
evolving application of GAI models in finance, this paper aims to address the following
research questions:
• RQ1. What are the current trends and advancements in the application of GAI within
the financial sector?
• RQ2. How does GAI, beyond LLMs, contribute to solving financial tasks and challenges?
• RQ3. How can BERTopic be used to systematically classify and analyze research on
GAI in finance?
• RQ4. What are the risks and challenges associated with the use of GAI in finance,
and how have these been addressed in the literature?
The structure of our paper is as follows. In Section 2, we examine the papers relevant
to this topic. In Section 3, we introduce the dataset and the topic modeling method used
in this study. Section 4 presents the results of our analysis. In Section 5, we provide an
in-depth discussion based on the new framework obtained through the topic modeling
method. In Section 6, we discuss our contribution, future directions, and potential areas for
further research. Finally, we give a conclusion in Section 7.
2. Literature Review
The field of GAI has experienced rapid advancement in recent years. One of the
famous GAI methods is the VAE algorithm, developed by Kingma and Welling in 2013 [ 9].
VAEs applied probabilistic frameworks to generate new data points based on latent rep-
resentations learned during training. Therefore, it enhances the ability to model complex
distributions in data. Subsequently, in 2014, Goodfellow et al. [ 10] introduced the GAN
model, which represented a paradigm shift in generative modeling. It is an adversarial
process involving two neural networks: a generative model to capture the data distribu-
tion and a discriminative model to distinguish between real data and generated samples.
This adversarial framework enabled GANs to produce remarkably realistic outputs across
various domains, such as images and texts.
In 2017, Transformers was introduced by Vaswani et al. [ 11]. It leverages self-attention
mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them highly
effective for various natural language tasks. This innovation inspired the development
of LLMs, particularly transformer-based architectures like OpenAI’s GPT series [ 12–15]
and Google’s BERT [ 16], which marked a significant advancement in natural language
processing. The deployment of LLMs has expanded generative AI into sophisticated
applications requiring the comprehension and generation of human-like text. Additionally,
Diffusion models have emerged as a novel approach in GAI, focusing on modeling temporal
dependencies and irregular patterns in sequential data [ 17]. These models have shown
promise in applications where traditional generative models fall short, particularly in
capturing the nuances of dynamic and time-series data.
From the financial researchers’ perspective, the impact of LLMs’ applications is most
significant and far-reaching. In the past two decades, financial text mining has been a
popular research area, especially with advancements in computational methods that have
made processing large-scale data possible. Beyond conventional financial data sources such
as public companies’ annual reports and earning announcements, financial researchers
have turned to financial news press, regulatory filings, and social media to uncover hidden
information and sentimental cues. These insights can be used to predict investment
behaviors and trends in stock returns. For instance, Bollen et al. [ 18] investigated whether

=== Page 3 ===
FinTech 2024 ,3 462
measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated
to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. Wisniewski and
Yekini [ 19] analyzed the qualitative part of annual reports of UK-listed companies and used
the frequency of words associated with different language indicators to forecast future
stock returns. McGurk et al. [ 20] examined the relationship between investor sentiment and
stock returns by employing textual analysis on Twitter posts and found that their investor
sentiment measure has a positive and significant effect on abnormal stock returns.
Most of these earlier studies are still exploratory, often reducing text information to
“a bag of words” or representing it through dictionary-based sentiment scores. This is
primarily because financial texts frequently lack a regular structure, and verbal/textual
communication can be subtle and complex. Additionally, financial jargon can vary in
meaning depending on the context. To extract more meaningful insights from financial
texts, more advanced models are required. LLMs trained on extensive datasets from diverse
sources and themes can provide more sophisticated text representations that capture the
nuances of financial language. In the literature we surveyed, Gupta [ 21] simplified the
process of assessing annual reports of all the firms by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs,
where the insights generated by the LLM are compiled in a Quant-styled dataset and
augmented by historical stock price data. Fatemi et al. [ 1] showcased the remarkable
capabilities of LLMs, even smaller models, in both fine-tuning and in-context learning
for financial sentiment analysis. Li et al. [ 22] reported evidence that general-purpose
LLMs, especially GPT-4, could outperform domain-specific models in terms of sentiment
analysis. Pavlyshenko [ 23] demonstrated that Llama 2 can be fine-tuned and multitask;
when analyzing financial texts, it can return both a structured response and sentiment data
in specified JSON format, which can further be loaded directly into predictive models as
features. On the other hand, Xing [ 24] reported that a design framework with heterogeneous
LLM agents can be effective in financial sentiment analysis without fine-tuning.
In general, the financial sector, characterized by its vast and complex data, stands to
benefit immensely from these advancements in GAI. Traditional data analysis methods
often fall short in handling the scale, variability, and intricate patterns inherent in financial
data. GAI offers a promising solution by not only managing large datasets effectively but
also generating synthetic data close to real-world financial data. This capability is partic-
ularly important for applications such as risk management, fraud detection, algorithmic
trading, and financial forecasting. Recent years have seen the emergence of specialized GAI
models tailored for financial applications. Finance-specific LLMs, such as FinGPT [ 25,26]
and FinPT [ 27], have been developed to address domain-specific challenges and have
shown superior performance compared to general-purpose models in various financial
tasks. Despite the promising advancements, the integration of GAI in finance is not without
challenges. Issues such as data privacy, model interpretability, regulatory compliance,
and the potential for generating biased or misleading data necessitate careful consideration.
The ethical and social implications of deploying generative AI in financial decision making
further underscore the need for robust frameworks and guidelines to ensure responsible
use [28].
Most importantly, there is a limited body of research that surveys the intersection of
GAI and finance [ 3–7], and none of these studies employ advanced topic modeling tech-
niques to mine potential topics from paper abstracts. Using a topic model like BERTopic [ 8]
for paper reviews offers significant advantages over manual review, especially when deal-
ing with large datasets. They usually provide an objective, unbiased grouping of papers,
uncovering hidden patterns and emerging trends that may be missed by human reviewers.
Additionally, they ensure consistency across the entire dataset and allow researchers to
focus on the most relevant areas, making it easier to manage large-scale literature reviews.
From the above review, it is evident that while significant progress has been made in
applying GAI to finance, many challenges remain underexplored, particularly in terms of
integrating various GAI models and uncovering new insights through more sophisticated
topic modeling methods.

3. Materials and Methods
This study leverages the Google Scholar database for its extensive coverage, interdisci-
plinary reach, and up-to-date research indexing. Given that research on GAI, particularly
LLMs, is relatively new and rapidly evolving, Google Scholar’s comprehensive indexing
of reputable authors and institutions is particularly valuable. Many significant papers
are submitted to repositories such as arXiv and SSRN, both of which are well indexed by
Google Scholar.
We conducted searches using two key combinations: (1) “generative AI and finance”
and (2) “large language models and finance.” From these searches, we retrieved a total of
90 papers published between 2018 and 2024. These papers were sourced from a diverse
range of publishers, including ACM, ACL, arXiv, Curran Associates, Darcy & RoyPress, El-
sevier, IEEE, MDPI, Routledge, SSRN, Taylor & Francis Online, and MIT Press. The dataset
consists of academic papers from multiple disciplines, with a primary focus on Finance and
Computer Science. It also includes papers from related fields such as Economics, Business,
Management, and Accounting, ensuring a comprehensive scope. The authors in the dataset
are affiliated with a broad spectrum of institutions, ranging from elite universities like
Harvard, MIT, and Stanford to tier 1 institutions such as the University of Oxford and the
National University of Singapore. Additionally, the dataset includes contributions from
leading technology companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alibaba, as well as financial
institutions such as JP Morgan and Bloomberg. The dataset reflects a geographically di-
verse set of authors, with substantial representation from the US, Asia, and Europe. This
global distribution was intentional to capture a wide range of perspectives on the trends
and insights being discussed. As shown in Figure 1, about half of the papers come from
Asia, while roughly one-third are from the US. This distribution is consistent with the
fact that the US and China are leading countries in research on generative AI models and
their applications.

ing to the data.
To effectively cluster and analyze these papers, we applied a robust topic modeling
technique known as BERTopic [ 8]. Topic models are powerful unsupervised tools for
uncovering themes and underlying narratives in textual data.

=== Page 5 ===
FinTech 2024 ,3 464
BERTopic Model Specification: To generate coherent topic representations, the
BERTopic model will employ three steps. The first step is to generate document em-
beddings. In this step, the Sentence-BERT (SBERT) framework [ 29] was employed to
convert each paper’s abstract into a vector representation. The SBERT uses pre-trained
large language models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various embedding
tasks, generating high-quality document vector representations. The second step is to
cluster these document embeddings. To achieve a robust cluster result, a dimension re-
duction technique named UMAP [ 30] was used, preserving more of the local and global
features of high-dimension document embeddings in a lower-dimension space. After that,
the HDBSCAN model [ 31] is used to cluster the reduced embeddings. The benefit of using
HDBSCAN is that we can model the outliers as noise, preventing any unrelated documents
from being assigned to any cluster. The third step is to model the topic representation with
documents in each cluster. The class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) method [ 8] is employed to
model the importance of a word to a cluster. BERTopic has shown effectiveness in various
applications, including systematic reviews [2,21].
BERTopic vs. LDA: While traditional topic modeling methods such as Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) [ 32] and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [ 33] represent docu-
ments as mixtures of latent topics using a bag-of-words approach, BERTopic enhances this
process with advanced techniques. The use of bag-of-words would disregard the semantic
relationship among words or lose the context information in a paragraph, resulting in a
failure of document representation. In contrast, the BERTopic model takes advantage of
pre-trained large language models to encode the meaning of texts into the document em-
bedding. Moreover, the BERTopic model performs better than the LDA and NMF methods
with the topic coherence and topic diversity metrics [8].
Our application of BERTopic in this study can be broken down into the following steps:
• Data Preprocessing: First, we convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity
and reduce redundancy; second, we use nltk.word_tokenize() to split the text into
individual tokens and WordNetLemmatizer() to reduce words to their base or root
form; finally, we use stopwords.words(‘english’) to eliminate the common stopwords,
as they usually do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the text.
• Fit the Model and Transform Documents: We use BERTopic and ClassIFidTransformer
to fit the model to our data and transform to discover topics.
• Topics Exploration: After fitting the model, we explore the topics generated by various
tools of BERTopic.
4. Results
In this section, we discuss the results obtained from the BERTopic model. After fitting
the model, we identified the most frequent topics in our dataset, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2 reveals four distinct clusters:
• “-1_chatbots_credit_reliable_chatgpt”;
• “0_llm_financial_model_task”;
• “1_ai_generative_risk_challenge”;
• and “2_data_stock_synthetic_market”.
Cluster -1 represents all outliers and should be disregarded. Consequently, our focus
will be directed towards the examination of the remaining three clusters. Cluster 0 per-
tains to discussions surrounding the application of LLMs in financial tasks. This cluster
highlights the innovative use of LLMs to address various financial modeling and task
automation challenges. Cluster 1 delves into the challenges and risks associated with the
implementation of GAI within the realm of finance. This cluster underscores the potential
risks and regulatory considerations that accompany the deployment of GAI technologies
in finance. Cluster 2 centers on the generation of synthetic financial data facilitated by GAI.
This cluster emphasizes the role of GAI in creating synthetic datasets, which are essential
for tasks such as market simulation and risk assessment.

Additionally, our analysis reveals a significant discrepancy in the distribution of
research focus. Specifically, there are approximately 47 papers discussing LLMs in finance,
a considerably higher count compared to those addressing the risks and data generation
aspects of GAI. This observation underscores that LLMs currently represent the foremost
research focus of GAI within the financial domain.
Figure 2. This figure describes the frequent topics obtained from the BERTopic model. Source:
personal processing according to the cluster results from BERTopic model.
Observing Table 1, we identify the representative words for each topic generated by
the BERTopic model. These words help elucidate the main themes and concepts of each
topic, as they are extracted based on their relevance and frequency within the topic. Topic -1
is ignored, as it is an outlier, so our analysis begins with Topic 0: “LLMs for Financial Tasks.”
Topic 0: “LLMs for Financial Tasks” : In addition to the key terms, such as ‘LLM’,
‘financial’, and ‘task’, that define this topic, other prominent words, like ‘model’, ‘language’,
and ‘large’, emphasize the core characteristics of LLMs. These terms highlight the foun-
dational role LLMs play in processing human text and understanding financial language.
Financial papers referencing LLMs often focus on the ability of these models to interpret
complex financial documents, automate tasks, and assist in decision-making processes.
Words like ‘benchmark’ and ‘performance’ are frequently used to evaluate how effectively
LLMs accomplish financial tasks, whether they are used for explaining phenomena such as
market trends, generating reports, or forecasting financial outcomes. The focus on ‘bench-
mark’ results indicates the importance of validating LLMs against industry standards,
while ‘performance’ suggests the critical evaluation of their accuracy, speed, and reliability
in financial contexts. Thus, these terms collectively indicate that financial research using
LLMs aims not only to describe or analyze financial data but also to enhance forecasting
and predictive capabilities.
Topic 1: “The Risk and Challenge of Generative AI” : Key terms such as ‘AI’, ‘ar-
tificial’, ‘intelligence’, ‘generative’, ‘risk’, and ‘challenge’ are central to this topic. These
terms reflect the growing discourse around the potential risks and challenges associated
with implementing GAI in the financial sector. Additionally, the term ‘ethical’ frequently
appears, highlighting significant concerns about the ethical implications of GAI, particu-
larly in terms of transparency, fairness, and accountability. These ethical considerations are
especially critical in the financial industry, where GAI is used to automate decision-making
processes, and any misuse or bias in these systems can lead to substantial consequences.
Discussions in financial papers often focus on the risks associated with deploying GAI, such
as the potential for generating biased or inaccurate financial predictions, or the challenge
of ensuring regulatory compliance. Ethical debates are often tied to how GAI is trans-
forming the financial ‘industry’, affecting everything from risk management to customer
service. The common appearance of the word ‘paper’ in our dataset is largely due to the
review-based nature of this article and does not carry significant meaning in this specific
context. However, the focus on risks and challenges suggests that researchers are keen on

=== Page 7 ===
FinTech 2024 ,3 466
evaluating not only the technical capabilities of GAI but also the broader implications for
ethical and responsible use in financial applications.
Topic 2: “Synthetic Financial Data Generation” : The words ‘synthetic’ and ‘data’
are central to this topic, indicating the focus on the creation of artificial financial datasets.
Terms such as ‘network’, ‘GANs’, ‘learning’, and ‘adversarial’ suggest that many existing
studies utilize GANs for generating synthetic financial data, particularly for stock market
simulations. In practice, GANs are widely used to produce synthetic ‘stock’ and ‘market’
data, such as ‘price’ ‘series’, which are essential for financial modeling and analysis. These
synthetic datasets play a critical role in financial research, as they allow researchers and
practitioners to simulate various market scenarios, test trading strategies, and analyze
risk without relying on real-world data, which may be limited or sensitive. In financial
papers, the use of synthetic data is typically aimed at overcoming challenges related to data
availability, privacy concerns, and the need for large, high-quality datasets for machine
learning models. By generating realistic price series and market behaviors, researchers
can conduct more robust financial simulations, improving the accuracy and reliability of
predictive models. The prominence of terms like ‘network’ and ‘adversarial’ reflects the
technical focus on GAN architectures, which are key to producing high-fidelity synthetic
data that closely mirror actual financial markets. Thus, this topic underscores the practical
importance of synthetic data generation for enhancing financial forecasting, risk assessment,
and model training.

As discussed by Grootendorst [ 8] in the BERTopic model, the c-TF-IDF method is used
to calculate the word score for each cluster or topic. The definition of c-TF-IDF is as follows:
Wx,c=∥t fx,c∥ ×log(1+A
fx), (1)
where xis the word, cis the cluster, t fx,cis the frequency of word xin cluster c,fxrefers to
word x’s frequency across all clusters, and A represents the word’s average number per
cluster. Figure 3 tells us the 10 most important words for each cluster and their importance.
These word scores represent how strongly a word is associated with a particular topic
within the model. The higher the score, the more central the word is for defining the topic’s
theme. Practically speaking, these scores help us identify the most influential terms within
each topic, giving us insights into the key concepts driving the discussion in the data.
For example, in the context of financial papers, a high score for a word like ‘performance’
in Topic 0 means that researchers are likely to focus on improving or evaluating financial
LLMs’ performance in those papers. By identifying the most relevant words, we can better
understand the central themes of each topic and how they relate to real-world financial
issues like forecasting, strategy optimization, or the evaluation of financial instruments.

cluster 2. This visualization helps us understand the relationships and similarities among
the identified topics.

5. Discussion
In this section, we delve into three key topics derived from the BERTopic analysis.
The first topic explores the application of LLMs in finance across various tasks. This
includes discussions on the capability of general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPTs, Gemini) to
address financial problems, the effectiveness of finance-specific LLMs (e.g., FinGPT, FinPT)
compared to general-purpose LLMs, and the identification of benchmarks and financial
datasets that can be used to fairly evaluate the performance of LLMs in finance. The second
topic addresses the potential risks and challenges associated with GAI models for financial
applications. This includes an examination of issues such as hallucinations, ethical and
social impacts, and financial regulation. Finally, the third topic focuses on the use of GAI
for synthetic financial data generation. We will discuss the challenges and areas of focus in
this domain, as well as existing work utilizing VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models.
5.1. LLMs for Financial Tasks
5.1.1. General-Purpose LLMs
The rapid advancements in LLMs have ushered in a new era of innovation across
various sectors, with finance being a significant beneficiary. Over the past few years,
general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4 have been extensively studied by researchers. Teix-
eira et al. [34] and Krause [35] presented comprehensive guides to prompt usage in LLMs
for financial analysis. Rane et al. [ 36] explored a comparative analysis of Gemini and
ChatGPT, focusing on the discussion of these models’ effectiveness and performance in
finance and accounting tasks. LLMs have also been tested on a wide range of financial text
analytics tasks, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness [1,21–24,37,38].
General-purpose LLMs can also be used as investment advisors. The potential of
LLMs as financial robo-advisors has been rigorously assessed, generally showing good
performance [ 39–42]. Furthermore, Lu et al. [ 43] demonstrated that ChatGPT could poten-
tially generate portfolios that outperform the markets in out-of-sample tests. Additionally,
an innovative LLM multi-agent framework endowed with layered memories has been
proposed for stock and fund trading [ 44]. Their capabilities extend to financial decision

=== Page 9 ===
FinTech 2024 ,3 468
making [ 45,46], financial auditing [ 47], financial regulatory interpretation [ 48], financial
budgeting [ 49], financial risk management [ 50,51], and analyzing climate change issues
related to finance [52].
The reasoning capabilities of LLMs have also been studied extensively. Yu et al. [ 53,54]
examined LLMs’ ability for explainable financial time series forecasting, demonstrating
that these models can generate well-reasoned decisions. Srivastava et al. [ 55] explored
the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs on tabular question-answering datasets.
Additionally, a comparative study of LLMs for personal financial decision making in a
low-resource language, the Yoruba language, was conducted by Sikiru et al. [ 56]. The re-
sults indicate that the performance of LLMs is poor compared to their performance with
English financial data, highlighting the need for improvements in low-resource languages.
To address the high GPU memory consumption associated with LLMs, Liu et al. [ 57] pre-
sented high-performance GPU-based methods for pretraining and fine-tuning LLMs for
financial applications.
5.1.2. Finance-Specific LLMs
General-purpose LLMs offer versatility and adaptability for a wide range of financial
tasks but may lack the specialized domain knowledge required for complex financial
analyses. In contrast, finance-specific LLMs are exclusively trained on financial data.
For instance, BloombergGPT, trained on a diverse range of financial data, showcased
superior performance in financial tasks compared to existing general-purpose LLMs [ 58].
Similarly, FinMA was introduced by fine-tuning LLaMA with a tailored dataset, enabling it
to executive various financial tasks [ 59]. Furthermore, FinGPT emerged as an open-source
LLM tailored for the finance sector, providing accessible and transparent resources for
researchers and practitioners to develop their FinLLMs [ 25,26]. Additionally, Li et al. [ 60]
proposed a financial LLM (CFLLM) specially designed to adeptly manage financial texts.
On the other hand, LLMs fine-tuned by financial datasets leverage general-purpose
models and enhance their performance in finance-rated tasks through specialized training.
For example, Zhang et al. [ 61] proposed a simple instruction tuning approach to fine-tune
general-purpose LLMs, achieving remarkable achievements in financial sentiment analysis.
Similarly, Yin et al. [ 27] introduced FinPT, fine-tuned on LLMs with natural language cus-
tomer profile text for predictive purposes and pre-trained on a dataset containing Chinese
financial data, and a general-purpose dataset. Additionally, Yang et al. [ 62] presented
InvestLM, a financial LLM for investment, tuned on LLaMA with a financial investment
instruction dataset. Chen et al. [ 63] proposed a multiple-expert fine-tuning framework
for DISC-FinLLM, a large Chinese financial LLM. Finally, Chu et al. [ 64] created FLLM,
a financial LLM employing multitask prompt-based fine-tuning for data pre-processing
and pre-understanding, employing abductive augmentation reasoning (AAR) to overcome
manual annotation costs.
Multimodal financial LLMs combine the power of language understanding with the
rich information contained in financial data across multiple modalities. By integrating tex-
tual, numerical, and visual data, multimodal financial LLMs offer a holistic understanding
of financial information, enabling more accurate analyses, predictions, and decision making
in the financial domain. For instance, Wang et al. [ 65] introduced FinVis-GPT, a pioneering
multimodal LLM designed to interpret financial charts, marking a significant advancement
in the application of multimodal LLMs in finance. Similarly, Bhatia et al. [ 66] proposed a
multimodal financial LLM that integrates textual, numerical, tabular, and image financial
data, surpassing the performance of ChatGPT-3.5 in financial tasks.
By leveraging advanced language understanding capabilities and domain-specific
knowledge, non-English financial LLMs enable more accurate and nuanced analyses of
financial information in languages such as Japanese, Spanish, and beyond. For instance,
Hirano [ 67] developed a Japanese financial-specific LLM through continual pre-training,
while Zhang et al. [ 68] introduced FinMA-ES, an LLM tailored for bilingual financial

=== Page 10 ===
FinTech 2024 ,3 469
applications aimed at bridging the gap between Spanish and English financial natural
language processing (NLP) capabilities.
5.1.3. Benchmarks of LLMs in Finance
Benchmarks are crucial in evaluating the performance of LLMs in the financial do-
main. These benchmarks serve as standardized tests or datasets against which various
LLMs are assessed, allowing researchers, practitioners, and developers to compare and
contrast the effectiveness of different models in handling financial tasks. For instance,
Xie et al. [ 59] proposed a standardized benchmark covering a range of financial tasks,
while Zhang et al. [ 69] introduced FinEval, a benchmark specially tailored for the financial
domain knowledge in LLMs, including multiple-choice questions covering various topics
in business. Guo et al. [ 70] presented FinLMEval, offering a comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs in financial NLP , and Xie et al. [ 71] proposed an open-source evaluation benchmark
encompassing 35 datasets across 23 financial tasks.
Additionally, Yin et al. [ 27] provided high-quality datasets on financial risks,
Lei et al. [ 72] introduced CFBenchmark for evaluating LLMs for financial assistance, and Is-
lam et al. [ 73] proposed FinanceBench for assessing LLMs’ performance on open book finan-
cial question answering (QA). Zhang et al. [ 74] curated a practical Text-to-SQL benchmark
dataset, beneficial for financial professionals less-skilled in SQL programming. Li et al. [ 75]
introduced the AlphaFin dataset for pretraining or fine-tuning financial analysis LLMs,
combining traditional research datasets, real-time financial datasets, and handwritten
chain-of-thought (COT) data. Furthermore, Hirano [ 76] constructed a benchmark specific
to the Japanese financial domain, while Xu et al. [ 77] proposed a benchmark for evaluating
Chinese-native financial LLMs.
5.2. The Risk and Challenge of Generative AI
5.2.1. Hallucination
In the realm of GAI, the phenomenon of hallucination manifests when a model gener-
ates data or information that deviates from accurately representing the underlying patterns
or realities. This occurrence can engender misleading predictions, instill false impressions,
or prompt erroneous conclusions based on the generated data. The ramifications of such
hallucination are particularly acute within the financial domain, where precision in data
and prognostications holds paramount importance for informed decision-making processes.
An illustrative case in point is the investigation into GPT-3’s efficacy in analyzing climate
change related to its financial implications, as undertaken by Leippold [ 52]. Nevertheless,
the inquiry unveiled an issue of hallucination during an interview with the GPT-3 model.
Further empirical examination of the financial tasks’ hallucination behaviors was conducted
by Kang and Liu [ 78], who evaluated the efficacy of various methods, such as few-shot
learning and the retrieval augmentation generation method, in mitigating hallucination in
LLMs. Their findings underscored the substantial presence of hallucination behaviors in
off-the-shelf LLMs when applied to financial tasks.
Consequently, it is imperative that forthcoming research endeavors prioritize strategies
aimed at circumventing hallucination by GAI models. Roychowdhury [ 79] delineated
three major stages to design hallucination-minimized LLM-based solutions tailored for
the financial domain’s decision-makers: prototyping, scaling, and LLM evolution using
feedback. These measures ensure that GAI chatbots, autonomous reports, and alerts are
reliable and high-quality, thereby facilitating key decision-making processes.
5.2.2. Ethical and Social Impact
GAI represents a remarkable tool for discerning users, yet it necessitates critical re-
flection on the ethical implications and societal ramifications of its integration into the
financial industry. Rane [ 28] extensively explored the multifaceted role and challenges
encountered by GAI tools within the intricate realms of finance and accounting, elucidating
both their transformative potential and the hurdles that must be overcome to genuinely

=== Page 11 ===
FinTech 2024 ,3 470
revolutionize the financial landscape. Similarly, Kalia [ 80] scrutinized the impact of GAI
on the financial sector, advocating for the establishment of robust privacy frameworks,
stringent enforcement of data protection regulations, and the promotion of responsible and
ethical deployment of these technologies by organizations and policymakers. Sarker [ 81]
delved into the myriad perspectives on LLMs, highlighting both their potentiality and
associated risk factors, underscored by heightened awareness. Additionally, Krause [ 82]
deliberated on the potential risks posed by GAI tools in finance and proposed comprehen-
sive mitigation strategies for businesses, emphasizing the importance of employing GAI
tools within closed networks, utilizing secure training data, the implementation of robust
security measures, providing employee training, and monitoring outputs.
Moreover, Remolina [ 83] emphasized the necessity of context- and sector-specific
debates to effectively address the risks and challenges inherent in GAI deployment. For in-
stance, generating financial advice content entails different societal implications than
generating imagery of a turtle. Lo and Ross [ 84] focused on three primary challenges
confronting most LLM applications: domain-specific expertise tailored to users’ unique
circumstances, adherence to moral and ethical standards, and compliance with regulatory
guidelines and oversight. Lastly, Yusof and Roslan [ 85] underscored the imperative of
continuous evaluation and adaptation of AI technologies within banking to simultaneously
maximize benefits and mitigate associated risks. Collectively, these perspectives under-
score the intricate interplay between technological advancement, ethical considerations,
and regulatory imperatives within the financial domain, urging stakeholders to navigate
these complexities with foresight and diligence.
5.2.3. Financial Regulation
The emergence of robo-advisors and advanced GAI models such as GPT-4 and Chat-
GPT heralds efficiency gains but also presents distinctive regulatory hurdles. Caspi et al. [ 86]
delved into the regulatory landscape surrounding financial advice in an era increasingly
shaped by GAI. Their study scrutinized the extant legal framework governing investment
advisors and broker-dealers in the United States, while also examining the ascendancy
and impact of robo-advisors and GAI. The pivotal role assumed by AI in the provision
of financial advice has necessitated a judicious approach to regulatory strategies. Each
regulatory strategy, whether predicated on disclosure mandates or outright prohibitions,
carries its own array of benefits and potential challenges. A robust regulatory framework
demands more than a cursory understanding; it mandates a comprehensive grasp of these
AI technologies and their ramifications.
5.3. Synthetic Financial Data Generation
5.3.1. Challenges of Generating Synthetic Data
The financial services sector produces an enormous amount of highly intricate and
diverse data. These data are frequently compartmentalized within organizations for several
reasons, such as regulatory compliance and operational requirements. Consequently,
the sharing of data both across various business units and with external entities like the
research community is greatly restricted. Therefore, exploring techniques for creating
synthetic financial datasets that maintain the characteristics of real data while ensuring the
privacy of the involved parties is crucial. Assefa et al. [ 87] emphasized the growing need
for the financial domain’s effective synthetic data generation and highlighted the following
three areas of focus for the academic community:
• Realistic synthetic dataset generation;
• Similarity calculation between real and generated datasets;
• Ensuring privacy constraints with the generative process.
While these challenges are also present in other domains, the financial sector’s addi-
tional regulatory and privacy requirements add a layer of complexity. This presents a unique
opportunity to study synthetic data generation within the context of financial services.

5.3.2. Existing Works by VAE, GAN, and Diffusion Models
From the literature, it is evident that most existing works on financial synthetic data
generation employ GANs. For instance, Zhang et al. [ 88] introduced a novel GAN architec-
ture to forecast stock closing prices, utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
as the generator. The LSTM generator captures the data distributions of stocks from the
given market data, generating data with similar distributions. Takahashi et al. [ 89] devel-
oped the FIN-GAN model for financial time-series modeling, which learns the properties
of data and generates realistic time-series data.
Koshiyama et al. [ 90] proposed using conditional GANs (cGANs) for trading strat-
egy calibration and aggregation, utilizing the generated samples for ensemble modeling.
Bezzina [ 91] examined the correlation characteristics of synthetic financial time series data
generated by TimeGAN, demonstrating that TimeGAN preserves the correlation structure
in multi-stock datasets. Ramzan et al. [ 92] explored GANs for generating synthetic data,
emphasizing the generation of datasets that mimic the statistical properties of input data
without revealing sensitive information. Vuleti´ c et al. [ 93] investigated GANs for probabil-
ity forecasting of financial time series, using a novel economics-driven loss function in the
generator. Ljung [ 94] assessed CTGAN’s ability to generate synthetic data, while He and
Kita [ 95] employed a hybrid sequential GAN model with three training strategies using
S&P500 data.
In addition to GANs, VAEs and diffusion models have also been employed for financial
synthetic data generation. Dalmasso et al. [ 96] introduced PayVAE, a generative model
designed to learn the temporal and relational structure of financial transactions directly
from data. Applied to a real peer-to-peer payment dataset, PayVAE demonstrated its
capability to generate realistic transactions. Huang et al. [ 97] developed a novel generative
framework called FTS-Diffusion, which consists of three modules designed to model
irregular and scale-invariant patterns in financial time series.

concerns, encompassing data privacy and responsible AI utilization, lays the groundwork
for the development of robust ethical guidelines and frameworks [ 2,98]. These frameworks
can serve as a foundation for guiding the deployment of GAI technologies in a manner
that adheres to ethical principles and aligns with societal expectations. This theoretical
foundation is paramount in ensuring that future research and applications of AI in finance
are demonstrably ethical and in accordance with societal norms.
The review further underscores the critical role of synthetic financial data genera-
tion through the utilization of advanced models like GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models.
By synthesizing past research on methodologies for constructing realistic synthetic datasets
while adhering to privacy concerns and regulatory compliance, the paper contributes to the
theoretical underpinnings of synthetic data generation in a financial context. This synthesis
serves as a roadmap for future research endeavors to refine the accuracy, utility, and ethical

making processes. The analysis of performance metrics and evaluation criteria for LLMs
equips managers with the tools necessary to develop effective implementation strategies
for integrating these technologies into financial operations [3].
Furthermore, the review emphasizes the critical need to address ethical considerations
and potential risks associated with the deployment of GAI technologies. Financial managers
can benefit from the comprehensive frameworks and risk management strategies outlined
within the review, which provide guidance for the responsible use of AI and the mitigation
of potential legal and reputational risks. This proactive approach ensures the ethical and
responsible implementation of AI technologies, fostering trust and confidence amongst
stakeholders [48].
Finally, the review highlights the practical applications of synthetic financial data gen-
eration, offering managers valuable insights into how these technologies can be leveraged
to enhance decision making and bolster the resilience of financial institutions. By investing
in the generation and utilization of synthetic financial data, managers gain access to robust
datasets that can be employed for financial modeling, stress testing, and scenario analysis,
ultimately leading to improved strategic planning and risk management capabilities [87].
6.3. Future Research Agenda

6.3.1. Intertwined Ethics and Performance Optimization
Central to this approach is the integration of ethical considerations within the per-
formance optimization framework for LLMs employed in finance. This entails ensuring
that while LLMs are optimized for financial tasks, the resultant outcomes remain fair,
transparent, and accountable. Ethical considerations encompassing data privacy, respon-
sible utilization of AI, and the potential for model hallucination (generating irrelevant
or misleading outputs) must be embedded within performance evaluation and optimiza-
tion strategies. This ensures that advancements in model performance do not come at
the expense of ethical standards, fostering the development of trustworthy and socially
responsible AI applications in the financial domain.
6.3.2. Synthetic Data: A Boon for Performance Benchmarking
Synthetic financial data have the potential to serve as a valuable tool for evaluating
and benchmarking the performance of LLMs specifically designed for finance, while simul-
taneously safeguarding privacy concerns. By leveraging advanced techniques like GANs,
VAEs, and diffusion models, researchers can create realistic yet privacy-preserving datasets.
These datasets can facilitate extensive testing and validation of models, guaranteeing that
performance metrics are reliable and reflect real-world scenarios. It is imperative, however,
to address privacy concerns and uphold regulatory compliance during synthetic data
generation to maintain public trust and adhere to legal requirements.
6.3.3. Ethical Considerations in Synthetic Data Generation
A crucial aspect of this research agenda involves addressing the ethical risks associated
with synthetic data generation. Researchers must meticulously consider the ethical implica-
tions and potential risks to ensure responsible use of this data. This entails guaranteeing
that the synthetic data are generated in a manner that does not inadvertently introduce
biases or other ethical concerns. Specific considerations include potential biases in data
generation, the possibility of data misuse, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks
to guide ethical practices. By adhering to these principles, researchers can uphold the
integrity and reliability of the models trained on such data.

=== Page 15 ===
FinTech 2024 ,3 474
By pursuing research that investigates these interconnected areas, significant contribu-
tions can be made towards the development of robust, ethical, and high-performing LLMs
within the financial sector. This holistic approach fosters a collaborative environment where
advancements in one area bolster developments in the others, ultimately leading to a more
integrated and responsible application of LLMs in the realm of finance. Figure 5 serves as a
visual representation of the proposed future research agenda, highlighting the critical areas
of focus and their interconnections, thereby providing a roadmap for researchers to create
comprehensive and ethically sound financial AI systems.
The future research agenda outlined in Figure 5 emphasizes three pivotal areas of
exploration to advance the relationship between GAI and finance. First, it calls for a

finance-specific models, stressing the need for rigorous performance evaluation and opti-
mization strategies to better align with financial domain requirements. Second, this paper
underscores the significance of synthetic financial data generation through sophisticated
generative models such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models. This approach is paramount
for mitigating privacy risks and ensuring adherence to regulatory frameworks, thereby
bolstering the trustworthiness and practical utility of GAI in finance. For instance, a wor-
thy avenue of exploration is the potential impact of generative art Non-Fungible Tokens
(NFTs) on NFT price volatility [ 99]. Third, it underscores the necessity of ethical and
risk considerations in deploying GAI, particularly regarding data privacy, responsible AI
utilization, and minimizing risks such as hallucination. Together, these focal points provide
a comprehensive roadmap for future research, advocating for a balanced approach that
integrates technical advancement, ethical governance, and domain-specific customization
at the intersection of GAI and finance [98].
7. Conclusions
The integration of GAI into the financial sector is revolutionizing various facets of
financial technology, particularly in areas such as data analysis, predictive modeling,
and synthetic data generation [ 100]. By harnessing advanced AI techniques, financial
institutions can process voluminous datasets with unprecedented efficiency, uncover pat-
terns and trends that were previously hidden, and generate synthetic datasets that are
crucial for developing robust models without compromising sensitive information. This
review highlights the significant advancements achieved with key generative AI models
like VAEs, GANs, LLMs, and diffusion models [ 101]. These models have opened new
avenues for predictive analytics, risk assessment, fraud detection, and personalized finan-
cial services. However, while these cutting-edge technologies offer substantial benefits,
there are still considerable challenges that need to be addressed, such as ensuring data
privacy, improving model interpretability, and maintaining regulatory compliance in an
evolving legal landscape. Future research should prioritize enhancing model robustness
to better withstand adversarial attacks and market volatility, increasing transparency to
build trust among stakeholders, and establishing ethical standards to guide the responsible
use of generative AI in finance. This includes developing frameworks for responsible AI
governance, ensuring accountability, and minimizing biases that could lead to unfair out-
comes [ 102]. By tackling these challenges comprehensively, the financial industry can fully
realize the transformative potential of generative AI, driving innovation while safeguarding
the integrity and fairness of financial systems.
